            <image:caption>Un racconto della storia dell'acqua...del ciclo dell'acqua: un giro del mondo spettacolare passando dalle nubi al ghiaccio, dai torrenti ai fiumi e dal mare ai suoi organismi, per lo più, fatti del 70% di acqua!
                L'acqua è preziosa, in ogni sua forma... e l'essere umano rappresenta gran parte della causa per cui l'acqua, appunto, sta perdendo di valore e qualità. AQVA VITA MUNDI vuole essere una riflessione sul valore dell'acqua a tutto tondo e sul rapporto dell'uomo e della natura con essa.

            <image:title>The Ghost</image:title>
            <image:caption>The main concept of the story behind our music video fits in the classic theme of Damsel in distress. A young woman in danger is fleeing away from the ghosts belonging to the most important representatives behind contemporary art, towards which we have an ambivalent attitude. They are all men and they are: Theodor. W. Adorno, Andy Warhol, Salvador Dali, Jackson Pollock, and the death is depicted by Marcel Duchamp.
                The video, recorded in Sweden, is inspired by Ingmar Bergman's "The seventh Seal", Maya Deren's videowork "Meshes of the afternoon" as well as the convention behind horror movies from the 50s. The theme behind a runaway girl in danger came to life from our need to juxtaposing Arnold van Genneps' concept of Rites of passage with Igor Stravinsky's Rites of Spring. The girl who is too good must die for the collective, for the rebirth of nature and art.
                Filmed in the following locations in Sweden: In Kungsbacka, in an abandoned amusement park - Fun City outside of Varberg and on Styrsö - a small island situated in Göteborg Municipality.</image:caption>

                In a dark universe, there is a lonely planet filled with flowers. The roots of the plants are digging and burrowing restless and deep underground. When the roots find something to hold on to, the planet blossoms and the whole universe lights up.

            <image:title>Let’s Get High with SmitHIcam</image:title>
            <image:caption>SmitHIcam is the Smith HIGH camera support: With high camera position and a low grip, it is a simple, lightweight, and low-cost way to create video with reduced camera shake. It produces better results compared to when a camera is hand-held. It is ideal for no-budget film-making, and for use with smaller camcorders or DSLRs, in the absence of access to a dolly or Steadicam. The main idea is that camerawork can be smoother with your arm by your side, rather than extended, or flexed to low angles. The counterbalance makes it stable both vertically and horizontally, so SmitHIcam can be held level and steady on uneven surfaces.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Yeah- It's Better to Eat</image:title>
            <image:caption>I've been working with cats and ferals for decades now. Public awareness is increasing but these individuals would really benefit from further consideration and compassion, just as we do. This footage is from last year. The calico, Goldie, is still outdoors with a new family that my sister, mother, and I are working to bring in. Of the kittens in the video, I placed the orange and the black- Fireball &amp; his sister, Stealth- with a compassionate neighbour just following Hallowe'en 2015. The grey &amp; white was unfortunately run over and killed. I don't know what became of the others, though the neighbourhood was aware of them and I'm hoping they found homes. The black cat in the video, Sweety Pie, was brought in last fall, but I had to release her since upon examination I found she was nursing at the time. I managed to get her in again last week- this time, in time- she gave birth to four black kittens July 24. She and the little ones are safe and sound, now.

                The commentary in the film was unscripted. I filmed Sweety Pie one night thru my living room window. My sister was quite ill at this time last year and in the background we hear her discussing a stomach ache (missed appendicitis at the hospital, which, very thankfully she's recovered from) and "trading one thing for another", along with whether it's better to eat or not. I chimed in, in keeping, I think with Sweety Pie's view, that "Yeah- it's better to eat." It was an interesting overlap, I think, and a microcosmic illustration of frame of reference.

                Poverty, originating in human domination structures and spirit, extends oppression.

                Update: we got Goldie in, along with 2 of her kittens from her Spring litter. She gave birth to a new litter of 4 females, including a calico :) one week after she came inside. All are safe and sound and will be warm for the winter, and ever after.

                Watch the trailer here - http://bit.ly/cookietrailer

                Wendy and Tanushree share a sentiment more than friendship,which of course their landlady- a representative of the "reputed society" they live in, denies. Regular chaos is common &amp; a Christmas day turns out bad for Wendy when her dog Cookie ends up injured. Horrified by a message in a fortune cookie that the waiter had handed her before, Wendy breaks down &amp; her mask of self-sufficiency tears apart. She needs Tanu by her side but faces an un-anticipated decision, as Tanu ends their relationship. Further predicaments follow &amp; Wendy suffers from hallucinations in a state of limbo, to the point of seeing herself falling from heights or dying unexplainibly. But "we are in a state of waking when we dream". Even though she is jarred out of her nightmares by a loving touch of Tanu, the promise of prevailing darkness remains &amp; one might fear if the cycle will go on &amp; on.

            <image:caption>Nearly 8,000,000 people die of starvation each year when most are walking distance from wild edible plants! Over 20,000 species of edible plants exist in the world, yet only 20 species provide 90% of our plant-based foods. In Los Angeles alone, over 2,000 species of wild edible plants exist, yet most people here could not name one of them. We're going to change this in a fun, exciting way!

            <image:title>Sonia's Story</image:title>
            <image:caption>The short movie is set in Florence in the '70s. It opens with a tribute to the Sergio Leone’s movie “The good, the bad and the ugly”. All children who were born in Italy in the ’60 knew about this film. The Director’s quote from the famous “Triel” is the stylistic device to introduce the story of Sonia from age 11 to adulthood. The spectator gets in touch with the feelings of an entire generation through Sonia's life. That historical and political period in Italy is marked by terrorism and the movie describes the generational conflict of people at that time. Following utopian ideals, some Italian young people renounced their backgrounds and behaved violently. In the film, this behaviour is evoked as Sonia's emotional journey. Due to her actions, she lived a long period of detention, during which time she constructively reviewed her past. Sonia's life is marked by her love for art and beauty, so the Roman amphitheatre in Fiesole where she used to play as a child, welcomes her, at the end of her personal renaissance, finally free.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Grampy</image:title>
            <image:caption>A documentary filmmaker follows her grandfather to Liverpool as he re-discovers his tragic post-war childhood.
                Grampy finally reveals secrets kept since childhood - a series of unfortunate events peppered with all kinds of abuse and neglect.
                'A lot of people have no idea what goes on behind closed doors... I just felt, at my time of life, the time had come to say something about it. Weather its important to anyone or not... I don't know. But those who are interested will know...what happened.'
                'Grampy' depicts a fight for normality which seems other-worldly, yet starkly relate-able by many even today.

                Grampy, (Eric Galvani) was evacuated from Liverpool at the age of 5 during WW2. Having already lost his mother, he was taken from the rest of his family and moved around the countryside. However, the worst was yet to come. A poverty-stricken post war Liverpool was waiting for him at the end of the war, and so were his bitter stepmother and volatile father. The youngest of 8 children, Eric faced a hungry childhood which might take his whole life to come to terms with. 'The adults who were supposed to act in my interest... I would say to them, Look at me and speak to me, as if I'm a fellow human being...not turn your back and ignore me as you might do a dog that's running round on the floor.'</image:caption>

            <image:title>The Monkey With Harmonica</image:title>
            <image:caption>A runaway monkey plays harmonica and kills a house painter in the circus.

                Genre: Thriller, mystery, drama

                Klement (45), a worker, is perched onto a 5-meter scaffold. He’s very tired and from time to time falls asleep. While he’s painting the walls, a runaway circus Monkey playing harmonica blues enters. Klement nervously calls the Monkey with a bad name, threatening to take its freedom away. The Monkey comes under the scaffold and pushes it. Klement falls down and is taken by The Doctor (55) and the Driver Z (40) to a hospital while the monkey disappears. On the way to the hospital, Driver Z drives the ambulance with the siren beeping. Driver Z ignores a mandatory turn signal from a Traffic officer standing in the middle of the crossroad and continues driving down the empty boulevard. Two luxury cars with the engines turned on are parked side by side on the road. The Director and Driver X are speaking indistinctly through the windows. The ambulance stops for a moment with Driver Z observing the two cars on the street blocking it. After a while, he drives the ambulance in reverse, sets parking brake, then puts the vehicle in the first gear and accelerates, warning the two drivers with a loud revving before heading rapidly down the middle of the road. At the last moment, the two luxury vehicles move to the pavement letting the high-speed ambulance to pass exactly between. On the inside of the ambulance, the Doctor holding a stethoscope on the chest of Klement announces his death. In the circus The Sweeper cleans the blood pool with a broom. The Director enters the circus and nervously asks for Klement before sighing unhappily and going to his office. Hearing the phone ringing from the inside, he enters and starts talking to an unidentifiable person, narrating the incident with the ambulance car. Suddenly, The Director’s conversation is interrupted by a harmonica blues. The Monkey plays the harmonica slowly walking through the hall all the way to the office. The Director gets off from the phone. The Monkey walks to the door of the office and stops playing. It dismantles the harmonica and gets a knife from it, lowering it. The Director moves his hand towards the lock, getting ready to open the door.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>For a world with a finite number of resources, communities today are faced with a global crisis in terms of how we spend our resources and how we choose to reduce our waste. How can we reduce our raw trash output? How can we make use of our recycling patterns, and amplify its effects in order to save our planet? In the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan, a creative reuse center has helped pioneer a local movement in recycling and artistic reuse. Tapping into art’s therapeutic elements as a means of community and social change, these artists have begun a journey towards global resource reuse.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Cherry Days</image:title>
            <image:caption>In a small town in Aleppo’s suburbs, bombings never stopped for more than two years. During the very  hot summer of July 2014, the most followed sports event in the world took place: the FIFA world cup. The city is in ruins, women and children all left long ago, and a group of young men still tries to live day after day. This documentary shows the everyday life of the young Syrians today, and listens to what they have to say. Sports, poetry, dance and dreams are everywhere alongside bombings, tears and weapons. Discussing soccer and politics, criticizing the regime and the jihadis alike, these young people are surprising by how vulnerable and humant they are. They show a complex reality of a still hopeful youth, beyond the morbid images of the bloodiest war of our century.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Kung Fool</image:title>
            <image:caption>Kung Fool is a bizarre action short which which explores whether the pen is mightier than the sword when a Kung Fu teacher faces off against one of his students who may just be getting the better of him.

                Whilst the film is profound in its own ways, Kung Fool was meant to be an opportunity to pen an open letter to young film makers: in that this film was produced entirely on an iPhone 6s with no camera attachments, no external microphones and certainly no skilled cast whatsoever. Everything you see was borrowed from a friend and everyone you'll see is one of my friends. The reason I'm highlighting these facts is because I wanted to make a point in that you don't need thousands of dollars of budget to create something special. All you need is passion and let your vision drive the rest.

                I'll let you all decide if we succeeded at that.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Scopolamine</image:title>
            <image:caption>Scopolamine takes us through the story of a Colombian girl named Daniela, who now lives in London. She experienced a traumatic childhood with her mother being shot in the Colombian civil war and her father sexually abusing her. Fast forward to the present, she's 24 and settled in London perfectly; with a fancy apartment in Central London. She doesn't work as such, but she gets her money taking advantage of preying men using Scopolamine under the codename Daniela De'Ville Under the influence of Scopolamine, the subject becomes completely devoid of their free will and will obey any command from anyone. Throughout the story, we see how Daniela utilises this drug against males who are non the wiser to her real agenda... until she meets an established drug dealer called Nathan. A rising attraction is quickly struck up between the two, but Daniela is a heartless woman, with no love for men. And their brief relationship ends the same as every other one of her flings with male counter-parts... A paycheque for Daniela and a blank memory for her victim. But Nathan and his protege, Billy take money very seriously and, in turn, go to seek and find the conniving young woman.
                Daniela Lusero has rebuilt her life after a traumatic childhood in her hometown, Colombia. Her new life in London consists of posing under the codename Daniela De'ville in the streets of Soho, luring men in with her beauty then drugging them with Scopolamine. A dangerous, mind-controlling drug.</image:caption>

            <image:title>A sweet heart inside a cappuccino</image:title>
            <image:caption>A homeless man walks into a bar and after having left his two large bags on the floor, he timidly asks for a coffee, while a beautiful and elegant lady is sitting in front of a heart-shaped foam cappuccino. The bartender does not pay attention to the request of the homeless man, until he painfully throws  a handful of small coins on the bar counter. The barman, quite bothered, collects them, prepares the coffee and winks sweet smiles to the lady. He goes on  acidly talking about the homeless man. The lady looks at him with complicity, but then, something unexpected happens ...

                The homeless man represents  in a broad sense all the marginalized, but he could even be the person who sleeps under the bridge, but also a family man who has lost his job or his  house or whatever. Anyway, that shows the condition of most of the people who are now living "marginalized" by society for various reasons.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>May 11th, 1977, NASA launched their last Apollo Mission, Apollo 21. What was discovered has never been publicly acknowledged and is believed to be one of the biggest Government cover-ups in history. Did the men on this mission experience an Alien encounter? Now 37 years later, Wilbur, one of the former astronauts who led Apollo 21, is haunted by the memories of what he witnessed and lives a booze-riddled, debauched life with his young wife, Loraine. As he begins to question what really happened on the mission, strange occurrences begin to surround them as mysterious Orbs pass by unnoticed. Slowly they begin to unravel, slipping into insanity. Is it the work of Aliens? A black military operation, or is something far more sinister playing with their minds?</image:caption>

            <image:title>I Camminatori. Resoconto audiovisivo per isole erranti</image:title>
            <image:caption>Halfway between imaginative dimension and sound, between documentary and time-lapse, frames and sounds that inhabit the pictures of "I camminatori" (The walkers) bring into resonance the words of Testa's poems, framing each verse in a kind of instant sound.
                Conceived as a musical score, the film-installation is characterized by the double dialectic between sound and image: from one hand, the audio text alternates readings to actual soundtracks acousmatic poem, the image, from the other hand the visual part is played on the contrast between static and plasticity; slow movements of the machine that linger on landscapes where there is an absence of man, alternate with sequences in time-lapse and characterized by a frenetic pace and tight.
                A collage of stories and improvisations sequence where image and sound come together in a poietic and abstract dimension, while the rhythm, punctuated by the alternation of film shot and time-lapse, characterizes the formal symmetry.
                One possible reading of an archetype as widespread as mythological: the journey, the journey undertaken by hikers, explorers, the dreamers, the emigrants, to all those that move like real islands wandering between water and land borders in the world ,
                A trip, then, driven by the desire to explore the world that lies beyond the veil of everyday life behind and which are gathered and amplified anxieties, instincts and psychology that belongs to the man of every time and every place.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Fixated explores the interaction between camera and subject, and the perception of sexuality and sensuality, through the eyes of the unconscious mind.


                Developed from the inquisitive imagination of Bonnie Curtis. Wanting to explore the stereotypical views of female sexuality and sensuality, Bonnie has brought to life a distorted image of feminine sexuality. Inspired by the imagery of iconic surrealist Salvador Dali and Sigmund Freud’s theories of the unconscious mind.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>We only ever see fragments of each other's lives, even the people we think we know well. In fact when it comes to our friends, our colleagues, our loved ones, we assume we know everything about them and make decisions, judgements based on these facts but life is unpredictable and the extraordinary is more regular than we think. Rumours is set on a day which should have been like any other: instead two colleagues share a moment that will shake their worlds forever.

                I wrote this short film because I sincerely believe that no matter how busy, how stressful our lives are we should all be kinder to each other.

                The aim is to make this script into an animation.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>This Doc-Short film tries to cover the Natak which is arranged by Jamdudhai gaushala mandal, every year at Dusshera (Indian festival), at Jamdudhai Village in Jamnagar, Gujarat. We have tried to cover an act of drama also known as Bhavai, which is the traditional form of gujarati theater.

                This Natak takes place with a motive of helping cows, birds and other domestic animals to get sufficient fodder even during the times of droughts or other natural calamities. Animals are also fed with green grass at every festival. This tradition was introduced by Maharaj Gopladas in 1941.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Por No</image:title>
            <image:caption>'Por no' is an experimental short film that strives to problematize sexual miscommunication, which derives from the universal topic of sex, being treated as something that needs to be spoken about eloquently, because when one doesn't speak about doubts, concerns, propositions, suggestions, ideas, fantasies and desires... It simply creates a taboo which will continue to grow, stemming from sexism and ignorance. 'Por no' is an aesthetic and conceptual experience, supported by aspects from Postporn and NeoCamp philosophies, and attempts to incite to a more creative (auto)exploration, and to better orgasms.</image:caption>

I think all people can relate to that feeling, It's just that very few of us really make those desires into reality.
                As always, I shot the video without the band having a clue what it was about until they saw it for the first time.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Twincarnation</image:title>
            <image:caption>Sisters Erika &amp; Elysia Aksos (Jessica Felice in a dual role)  were notorious murderers in the 1920's &amp; 30's with over 400 victims falling to their deaths ... when they were sentenced, the sisters said that they will be back.

                Almost 75 years later, Ron &amp; Melanie (Jason Klingensmith &amp; Melissa Heflin) purchase the Aksos's old house without knowing the history of the Aksos sisters. The Aksos sisters now see their opportunity to come back - to be reborn... and they are as Ron &amp; Melanie's twin girls - and pick right back up where they left off with the bloodshed.

                When the girls (Alexis Arnold &amp; Sailor Holland) turn 8 (again), all hell breaks loose! A little slip of the tongue from an old woman (Victoria Mullen) implants the Aksos name into Melanie's head, the story told to her by the Aksos cousin Krystof (Michael Sciabarassi) and with the help of her own mother (Lynn Lowry), Melanie tries to figure out if the Aksos twins have in fact been reborn as her daughters.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Kadooge! is a four piece heavy rock band based out of Aurora, IL. They've come together by creating powerful and fulfilling music that isn't safe or predictable. Their first album, "Nothing is Almost Everything" is a perfect example of great rock music with an experimental edge. The first single, My Shell, is not for the faint of heart (or beating heart rather.) The music video features the members of the band: Aerie Dover, Tony Montana, Pat Goode, and Quentin Dove braving the darkness. After breaking out of their "shells" they travel through a monochrome landscape of picture frames turned portals to another dimension, as they work their way through an existential crisis.</image:caption>

            <image:title>wars and game</image:title>
            <image:caption>In the previous days (January 2016) a video about an operation by the state forces was aired on social media,
                ...
                The video was not from Syria; it was a skirmish
                between the state and its own citizens in our geography.
                the video, three masked younglings, the items in their hands, and their intentions
                cannot thoroughly be perceived.However, as the state forces seemed to be in a good command of everything at the time and created the impression that they were at ease controlling the incident,
                the ‘mortal’ attack took place.
                Such videos might be circulated through the current period of ‘war’,
                On the other hand, they convey dialogues full of phrases like ‘wait, he’ll be down’,
                ‘we shot him down’ that are frequent in computer games and that can be considered
                as ‘alienation’ in a humanistic manner.
                ...
                The two-and-a half minute video in question was aired on Rudaw Turkish News.
                In that news, the discussions between the policemen were particularly focused on.
                It is also stated in the news that an officer was praying “Enfal Sura” from the Quran,
                and that this sura had a place in the Kurdish collective memory in connection with
                the pogroms by the BAAS regime in Southern Kurdistan.

            <image:caption>For most of us living in cities with dependable amenities, drought is something we see on TV or read on newspapers. Even if not for all the 24 hours, water does come to our houses and taps. This probably gives us an emotional distance from the people, animals, birds and landscapes affected by a drought. Because of this, we fail to understand that our actions have an impact too! This film is an attempt to build that bridge. It tells the two sides of a story, on one screen. It gives the full picture.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Dual Relationships</image:title>
            <image:caption>Concept-
                “In the field of health and medicine, a “dual relationship” is a relationship where multiple roles exist between practitioners and their clients.”
                In the pilot, Dave Barrett is introduced as a licensed massage therapist in his mid-thirties that moves his family to a small upstate New York town to pursue a better life.  Although he loves what he does, lately he has become disenchanted by how the business has become overrun with illegal practices which are slowly destroying his livelihood.  Dave’s cynicism is paired with a straight forward biting wit which sets him apart from the average massage therapist.
                Dave learns very quickly that small town living is not all it’s cracked up to be.  Early on he meets a client that has ulterior motives for befriending him.  Next, he finds himself in the middle of a kidnapping investigation.  Before he knows it, Dave is unwittingly thrown into a world where greed reigns supreme and the people involved will stop at nothing to get their way, whether it be financially or emotionally.  Ultimately, Dave learns a valuable lesson, “Be careful what you wish for.”  Unfortunately for Dave, he might learn that lesson too late.</image:caption>

            <image:title>The Lost Trace</image:title>
            <image:caption>Pride. Purpose. Promise. These are some qualities that embed deep within these signboards. The rich heritage - each individual story has a past. A past for the future to savour. In addition of the vast knowledge, the History and build up of the name, is being displayed proudly atop each shopfront. Weathering all the challenges throughout the test of time.

                This traditional signboards are losing their popularity amongst younger business owners. Contemporary choice of business name replaces real business owner's name in our modern society.

                we like to showcase the deeper meaning of these signboards in the hope to preserve traditions and ignite interest for such dying trade.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>The protagonist, Ulysses Tarnowski, is an up-and-coming performing artist living in Greenwich Village in the early 60’s. Ulysses himself is in his late 20’s, and moved to New York after growing up in Providence, Rhode Island. He was raised by his single mother, Margaret, a Holocaust survivor from Poland. Growing up, Ulysses knew nothing of his father aside from the fact that he was a married Merchant Marine when Ulysses’ mother became pregnant at age 16; a year before Ulysses left for New York, he discovered a photograph of his mother and a sailor, along with a letter addressed to Margaret from someone named ‘John Abraham’, presumably the young man in the photo and Ulysses’ father. It is worth noting that this story is not intended to take the side of anyone in particular - it just so happens to be something of a ‘bird’s eye view’ over Ulysses. The intent of the story is to start a conversation, and hopefully develop a distinct perception for the individual viewer - to me, that’s how life works. Nobody is 100% right or wrong; we’re all have our own unique perceptions and biases that are shaped by our individual human experiences. The great thing about telling this story is that it exists purely to provoke thought, even at the most basic of levels. The conflict of the story lies between Ulysses, and everyone else’s reaction to his art.</image:caption>

            <image:title>??Lost &amp; Gain</image:title>
            <image:caption>This movie is originally produced by high school students, aiming at expanding Chinese culture and promoting cultural exchanges between China and other countries. More importantly, it reminds people of the idea “Happiness lies in contentment” making the audience pondering the significance of “lost and gain”.
                Lost And Gain is a short narrative film. It tells a story of Zheng Hai in his 90s. 60 years ago (2016), the then overseas Chinese Zheng worked hard and he was quite successful in his career. Unfortunately, Zheng was diagnosed with cancer due to the workload. At the result, Zheng decided to go back to his hometown-Beijing-where he had not returned for so many years. In Houhai, a lake in the middle area of Beijing where had preserved so much historical culture, Zheng saw the place where he once lived during his childhood was as beautiful as before. It was so heart-warming to reunite with his family and friends. It was so charming to see people there living a life happily. Because of the disease, Zheng struggled with the idea of “life or death” in agony. With his deep contemplation, Zheng eventually came to realize the true meaning in the saying of “happiness lies in contentment” and the philosophy of “lost and gain”. Finally, he resolutely quit his job in the US and returned to his hometown. Thus Zheng has been living happily until now.</image:caption>

                Two friends are preparing for an important day. Both are praying with reading from the Quran.
                Both men take their leave from the respective partners and journey to the target destination, London’s Victoria railway station. It seems evident, from their behaviour, that they maybe intent to commit an act of terror.
                The first one appears highly stressed, becoming more agitated and physically and psychologically unwell.
                At the end of the film we will discover if they achieve their mission.</image:caption>

He discovers his greatest spectacle yet in the unlikeliest of places: the 2016 Republican primary. Murray uses the political circus of name calling and finger pointing to lure in a crowd of young bettors, exploiting their weaknesses and using them as a market for an even more profitable product: cocaine. He works hard to ignore the fact that he is addicted to his own merchandise, gambling in his role of bookie by giving odds that teeter on the edge of sanity, and hoping that the payoff will satisfy his narcotic sweet tooth for just one more week; when Murray's suppliers come to make good on his debts, however, he finds that his precarious balancing act comes with deadly consequences.</image:caption>

            <image:title>GATESEVEN</image:title>
            <image:caption>INSPIRED FROM A TRUE STORY - A haunted church that's been the site for gruesome murders and missing persons for years, invites the devil himself to come to earth unless he can be stopped by a professor of the supernatural and smart ass detective.  People go to a haunted cemetery amidst an abandoned church overlooking an endless field.  Gateseven used to be a regular
                town in the early 1900s until one day people begin to
                disappear.  When the townspeople searched for answers they find the town priest and his assistant making a human sacrifice. After a thorough search, they discover bodies underneath the church of all the missing people and more. They decide to hang the priest and his assistant in the church and burn the place to the ground. A few weeks later after all has returned to normal, the church somehow reappears more ominous and creepy than ever as things get worse than before. Everyone but a few move out as Gateseven becomes a ghost town, literally. Today kids go looking for a thrill, but end up missing or worse as detective Kastle Khan is called in to find out the mysteries of this place. Not knowing much of this kind of stuff, he searches for an expert in the supernatural field and finds the lovely, Dr. Katherine Hernandez, a professor on the matter. Together they delve into a mystery over their heads as Licone and his two wives, the only house and people to live at the town offer no help, only more mystery. Kastle learns about Katherine's past with this town and being one of the few to make it out of the field alive. All for a deeper purpose as we meet the Devil himself who is using Gateseven as his entrance to earth. Now he needs only a pure body for his voyage and woman for his breeding. He uses Licone as his servant to lure Kastle and Katherine into Gateseven for a lucrative reunion. Kastle and Katherine are the only ones who can stop the Devil's master plan, but also complete it. We learn that after his failure here at Gateseven, there are plenty of other gateways for the plan to succeed.</image:caption>

The mother stayed back, in Germany, hoping, in vain, to preserve what was left of the life that once was. The daughter fled to Britain, hoping to save her own life and the future she is carrying. Now, in the eve of a new life coming to the world, the two of them can only communicate through the 25 words the Red Cross messages permit. But the feelings and memories always have the power to go deeper than that.</image:caption>

            <image:title>The Goldenhill Fortune</image:title>
            <image:caption>Two brothers, Wilber and Reginald Goldenhill, are notified one day that their father, who left them when they were very young, has passed away. The father's long time friend and lawyer, Irwin Webb, comes and arranges a meeting with the brothers. He explains that when their father left them, he went on to become a very wealthy man. He has a very large inheritance to leave them. The lawyer plays a video of the deceased father giving the details. Here's where the catch comes in. In order to receive their inheritance, the brothers must fulfill their fathers last wish. The lawyer has a list of experiences their father had always wanted to share with his boys, but never did. They must experience them now, using the lawyer as the surrogate father. Irwin knew their father best, and Irwin is the one who makes the final call on whether the experiences are fulfilled or not. Once the list is complete, the Irwin will finalize the transfer of the estate and the boys will be rich beyond their wildest dreams. The screenplay won Best Comedy Script at the 2016 West Field Screenwriting Awards and was a finalist in the 2015 Creative World Awards and the 2015 Zed Fest Film Festival. The screenplay was also accepted into the 2016 Beverly Hills Film Festival, 2015 Hollywood Sky Film Festival and was a Screenplay 2nd Runner Up in the 2015 TMFF Film Festival.</image:caption>

            <image:title>The peacock</image:title>
            <image:caption>According to Taoist perspective on life, humans are controlled by their dreams, but these dreams are indeed ridiculous and moving in circle repeatedly. The film shows human being's ideal construction and state of mind--delicacy, absurdity, anxiety, and confusion. It also involves the debate over peacock's tail evolution in order to seek for the meaning of life
                I mixed my memories about school life and mind of states in my childhood into imagination, and deconstructed the ways to constructing dreams.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>“Orange” is a poetic and experimental short film which portrays the conflicts, taboos, fears and traditions of Iranian young generation facing modernity.
                "Orange” starts with POV shots that almost have the same durations. Until the fifth scene, they are either silent, or have sound without image. In addition to storytelling by using the elements of cinema such as: sound and motion picture, film gives a different concept to these elements and shows how form and content can’t be separated in a simple way.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Maya Derenkovska is a young Ukrainian photographer. After being raped, she addresses herself to the police to report her offender, but soon realizes that none wants to be bothered with such a “trivial”, domestic incident, while the country is in an unproclaimed state of war. Maya is a freelancer in charge of a reportage regarding “magic places” in Kyiv for a local anthropological magazine. These urban hills are desolate wastelands, where the only legacy of the ancient stories is the popular memory. But Maya has the gift to evoke the legends of the past with her imagination and to make them live again. While working on her reportage, she finds out that she is pregnant. The harsh reality and her vivid imagination intertwine, as Maya has to face the decision whether keep her baby or not.</image:caption>

            <image:title>KING</image:title>
            <image:caption>KINGis a film that is a concatenation of breath exercises that I film at 8 a.m. every day.  This 23 minute film encompasses about half a year of doing this exercise and focusing on the Bible, specifically the First Book of KINGS.  the animation is made from oriental lacquer scene boxes, some of them ancient and some of them new. The main percussion instrument involved is actually the frames for the top two shelves of a conversation table, made of gold colored metal, that probably had glass n it at some time,that I acquired when it was thrown over a top floor balcony of the building where I now live and have my small studio/office space. I grabbed the object out of the air before it hit my head and kept it and now use it as a musical instrument. The other percussion instrument is a hand made aboriginal drum, which can show the flow of water with time, of life and sequences of nature, because it has two sides that are used like tidal flows of oceans. Prayers for peace.</image:caption>

Whether it's as a director, producer, writer, editor, actor, ect., we love to learn to make better and better movies.
                A group of young, aspiring filmmakers and creatives collected $650, rounded up some committed crew/talent, acquired a Sony A7SII camera, and got to work on their first "featurette" film.
                All of production was operated, shot, and edited in Lafayette, Louisiana - with an entirely local and diverse cast and crew.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Uploaded on Sep 11, 2011

                "Spirit Inspectors" was a third rate documentary ghost hunting show attempting to answer one of the three great mysteries of life: where did we come from, why are we here and where are we going? Only ghosts could answer those questions and ambitious Ophelia Vane was determined to find one. They searched in the haunted Desert Inn at Yeehaw Junction and through the dark corridors of the Cuban Club of Ybor City but when Bobbi, suggested the infamous "Shock House" it seemed like the real deal. But no one who ever entered the weird house had ever returned. The ghost hunters were determined to uncover its secret even if it proved to be fatal for them all.</image:caption>

            <image:title>The Box</image:title>
            <image:caption>A Short film about a unexpected box at the door. Who dropped it off? Whats inside? Why did it come here?

                Director Biography

                Young filmmaker, Joshua has created many videos from music videos to weddings. 'The Box' will be his first short film he has created as a filmmaker.

                He has worked and learned along side award winning filmmaker Daniel Alexander, producing videos and ideas for future films.

                'The Box' has been Joshua's most recent and only film to date which has been submitted to many film festivals. He constantly has continuous, creative idea's wrote down which are in production.

                As well as Joshua wanting to become a professional filmmaker for his career, he also loves to do it as a hobby. He is very excited and eager to release more films to the public in the near future.

                Director Statement

                'The Box' which is a suspenseful thriller, with a run time of 4:34 minutes long, is a film about a women who has a strange box arrive at her door. She has no knowledge to whats inside, with a date on 'The Box', only time will tell whats sealed within.

                Actress, Charlotte Wisdom performed very well as it's my first time working with her. She tackled and executed everything I asked of her with no hesitation.

                The look I gave the film was a dull and eerie feel which I also wanted the viewer to feel enticed while watching. The sound effects, suspense music in the film and facial expressions made by Charlotte made me feel like I trapped a certain feeling. This feeling is perfect for the kind of film I was looking for with mystery. A lot of fast cuts were added to show different days to speed up the pace. Towards the end I slowed the cuts down with longer scenes to get the mind thinking into what is going on.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Efímera</image:title>
            <image:caption>Peregrín's first beauty film is “Efímera" (Ephemeral), a personal project about the unknown and the imperfect beauty and a wonderful reflection on the passing of time, a metaphor of the ephemeral nature of beauty and life.
                Focusing on the varied interconnected artistic looks of a female model, Efímera is a metaphor for the four ages of human beings. Concepts such as life and death are treated symbolically in this project helping Paco Peregrín to reflect on life´s fleeting solitude.
                Thanks to its very dramatic, powerful and artistic aesthetic, Efímera makes explicit reference to the quick passage of time but it is also a positive film about diversity and freedom that encourages us to enjoy and live life intensely without fears.</image:caption>

            <image:title>The Kneeling Man</image:title>
            <image:caption>Early in October of this year (2016), I saw a small item in a local paper in Taos, New Mexico, USA. It was about a man seen weeping, and kneeling as if in prayer, at a bus stop.  This video is my attempt to explore that story. I am not certain whether it is a very sad story, or an inspirational one...

                Or a tale that should terrify us all...revealing our moral insufficiencies, and portending an all too probable judgement.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Mimos</image:title>
            <image:caption>This is a biopic narrative film about Tarak Dutta, or Tarak Da as he is fondly called, who is a mime artist. He is one of the most prolific exponents of his art in this country who performed in the 70s and 80s in Calcutta, Raipur and Cuttak with masters of theatre like Habib Tanvir.

                He arrived in Mumbai with big dreams, only to find that the city of dreams is disillusioned with his art form. He realized that Mime is not recognized, not talked about, not dreamt for, and certainly not a means to earn his daily bread in this city of opportunities.

                Consequently, he worked in tea stalls, earned a few pennies doing construction labor, slept on roads, struggled barefoot; as the artist in him fell apart each day, like plaster wears off an old, unkempt house.

                Today, he lives with his wife in a small 50 square feet apartment in Malvani. A paralytic attack in 2014 has compromised his movements, but he still dreams of the stage, for that is where he belongs.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Moonie and the Spider Queen-15 min</image:title>
            <image:caption>Published on Jun 11, 2015

                Two bored space cargo men, Perry and Torry, run into the find of the millennium, a gal who can live in outer space without any life support. Because she lives on radiation, she wears very little clothing and rides through space an astercycle. They invite her aboard their ship but before they are able to transport her to Earth, she takes off to rescue her two sisters, who are being held captive by the terrifying Spider Queen. They take off after her to Phobia's planet. Sexy, exciting. This is a short, non-nudity version of the full adult version on moonieandthespiderqueen.com.</image:caption>

Each of these Oklahoma City districts may have a unique history and aesthetic, but they also have something in common: over the past few years they all have experienced a revival with the creation of regular events that bring businesses, neighbors, and “outsiders” together. District Up! is a feature-length documentary that shares stories and advice on district revitalization throughout Oklahoma City from the people who helped create positive change in their communities and want to inspire others to do the same.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>(Comedy, 86 minutes, color)

                "Why write...when you can be a Writer?"

                Victor d'Entrement is the quintessential young indie author--which is to say he is no longer young, "indie" because there is nothing else to call him, and not writing one damn thing. But he has a title for his masterpiece--and the more he does not write it, the more audaciously assured he becomes in his brilliance and in his inevitable posterity in the realm of American letters.

                MISSISSIPPY MISSIPPI TU-POLO, the new comedy from writer/director Pablo D'Stair (Hully Gully: a new American romance) is a skewering love letter to the soul (and ego) of the unknown artist.

                Five unknown, unread, and well-past-their-prime science fiction authors grapple with obscurity, infinity, and obsolescence (...and whether robots should legitimately be allowed to enter dance competitions). Filmed in the DOGME 95 spirit, SCIENCE FICTION is an existential comedy from writer/director Pablo D'Stair (HULLY GULLY: a new American romance; Mississippy Missippi Tu-Polo)</image:caption>

            <image:caption>“Reasons?” is a drama motion picture that deals with circumstances that everyday people have to face in their life. With the new stance against smoking in the last decade, “Reasons?” will help show why quitting smoking is a wise decision for the average human being.

                Four childhood friends decide to try smoking after watching their parents smoking in the living room. Fast forward twenty years, the group is still friends, but now they face the challenge of quitting after years of smoking, each choosing to quit for a different reason. Now faced with the challenges of fighting their dependence on nicotine, will they each have the power to overcome what faces them, or will they let their addiction rule their life?</image:caption>

            <image:title>ONE LIFE AT THE TIME: VARANASI</image:title>
            <image:caption>Mousa, a young man of twenty four, lives already half his life in Varanasi. Grown up in the slums of Delhi he was forced to live with his dad in the holiest city of India. Why? Simply because his mum and grandmother could not afford to have him anymore. With the small salary that his father owned being a ceremony assistant, Mousa started guiding tourist around in order to survive. On a lucky day he will get two dollars.
                Although India is getting wealthier when viewing upon the economic growth, the poverty level remains immense and millions of people continue living poor and destitute according to the statistic (Chandy and Amp; Gertz 2011). The impact of this staggering poverty is mostly seen in cities such as Varanasi, the largest city of India’s poorest state Uttar Pradesh. Huge and crowed places where there are simply more people than possibilities.
                A possibility for Mousa to build up a living would be to open a shop, according to him. It would give him a sustainable income on which he could build his life. Dreaming to have a roof above his head and maybe even a family one day, I can simply not resist sharing the possibilities of my world with him.
                With only threehunderd dollar Mousa could open his shop; a simple gesture from the Western world that changes a life time. Why not help him?</image:caption>

            <image:caption>The film ‘Red Thread’ is an animated documentary which is about Taiwanese history and identity. ‘Red thread’ is a metaphor throughout the whole film as a direction to guide the main character to find what is his identity. The red thread will only appear when the main character feels lost. The books ‘Orphan of Asia’ and ‘Potsdam Section Chief ’ were written by Wu, Zhuoliu, which inspired me to write my story and think about Taiwanese identity during different certain situations. I could see Taiwanese were struggling about being a Chinese, Japanese, Mainlander, Islander or pursuing western culture. I combined the true voices with my narrative story to elaborate real feeling to the audience. The goal of my film is that I hope Taiwanese would be willing to understand deeply of our own culture and be proud of being a Taiwanese. For others, I hope they will know more about what is Taiwan and have interest in Taiwanese history and culture.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>SERES is a different concept of a different time, where the past coexists with the future. A mystery arises where the instinctive and rational, the conscious and the unconscious, the music and the dance, are embodied in two beings. This encounter resonates in its environment, merging with it. Here, the interpretation is open: Is it the movement of the bodies that creates the music or is it the music that causes the movement? Is it the music that represents the nature that surrounds it, or is it the nature that makes the music emerge? The questions arise in a poem that turns on itself in an essentialism full of metaphors.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Dirty Roses</image:title>
            <image:caption>"Dirty Roses" is a humanitarian docudrama and deals with the power of the soul of the disabled persons and individuals or families who came from the Arab world in Greece as war or economic or political refugees. Two extreme marginalized groups with the most helpless victims, the one of the countries of the third world with racial and ethnic minorities, and the second one is often socially degraded. Their common field is the hope, their love to dream and their struggle to live in freedom, the triptych of the motto "that which does not kill us makes us stronger"!
                The heroes of the short film, Nana the Greek handicapped girl, Hassan the red roses' seller and Mirage an Iranian refugee, are the real characters and not professional actors. Several Afghani people who live with their children in a Greek camp appear in the film.

            <image:caption>Inside this experimental project, we are trying to explore the body and the way to dance, and we wanted to have everything be connect, body, dance, music, instruments, textures...
                The aims was we have to feel there is the most perfect combinaison between all the elements of the video.
                About the dance, there is something really intersting about the way they are dancing, basically the dancers didn't dancing on the music when we made the video. The dancers were dancing on Flying Lotus sound and kind of hip hop sound too. That's why we get something new about the dance.
                This is the unofficial video of Wyrd by Glass Animals (2016)

            <image:caption>Synopsis: Zombie Lee has an outrageous hunger that won’t be silenced by food alone. With his growing need to feed increasing, misjudgment and disaster arise in the kitchen, until a simple solution is found. And his rumbling is quenched.
                ‘Munchies’ is a stop motion animation, which depicts the struggles of a hungry zombie who is trying to cook a meal. I wanted to convey the idea that the hungrier you are the harder it is to concentrate and the easier it is to mess up. I aimed for my film to be humorous, but also a little unnerving to the viewer. I have included a couple of uncanny moments to remind the audience that he is dead but still human at times.</image:caption>

            <image:title>RIVVRS: CONQUER (A Music Video for Cystic Fibrosis Awareness)</image:title>
            <image:caption>I was humbled when asked to create the Official Music Video for RIVVRS' song CONQUER off his new album Unfamiliar Skin. I was even more humbled that it would serve as a dedication to my beautiful wife Kari, whom passed away from Cystic Fibrosis August 2015.

                This project means so much to me in so many ways, and it fills me with so much emotion. I shed a lot of tears (both happy and sad) creating this video - as it features the last footage we ever filmed together. It was quite an adventure making this, but every time I see her face on the screen I immediately feel at home. When I first heard this song, I instantly thought of Kari and how it exemplified her spirit and her courage. It made me think of how she fought for her life every single day with Cystic Fibrosis, and how she never let the disease defeat her. She never let it define her. She would always fight and never back down. This song perfectly depicts her unwavering strength and courage to never give up, and to never let life’s challenges keep her down.

                Everyone has something in their lives that is a challenge to them - something they need to conquer. Kari fought every one of her challenges head on. And no matter how hard things got, she always conquered them. This is a wonderful and powerful song that I think can be applied to everyone. I'm grateful to have been asked to be a part of this journey. Kari is my greatest love, my best friend, my biggest inspiration, and my muse. I hope everyone has the fight and determination Kari had, and no matter what happens, continues to fight, dream, breathe, believe, and ultimately - Conquer.

                Thank you for watching and best wishes,

In fact, that is the fear of all the people who live in the Una river basin, which is protected by the Law, people who live in the area of “Una National Park”, or just simply that is the fear of all the people that appreciate and love clean water, clean air and something that is beautiful. Everyone except the government of Republic of Croatia, who made the decision to start building, on this very place, the nuclear, toxic, radioactive dump for the waste from “Krško” nuclear power plant.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>WHAT WEEE ARE is an ongoing multifaceted socio-cultural multimedia project searching the deeper meanings of the world. A quest through waste and feelings and the richness of the earth, trying to untangle the intricacy of human, so called, society.
                Questions rooted deep inside ourselves which have been forgotten, traded in for a superficial world of dull bureaucracy, sexy images, cheap thrills and high tech. But what we really are is yet beyond our knowledge and despite all the civilization that has been built in the name of progress and growth, society is falling to pieces leaving nothing more than a toxic wasteland.
                As the Phoenix arose from its own ashes, will humanity also rise from its own waste?
                This everlasting cosmogony is represented in WHAT WEEE ARE a collection of sculptures in which electronic waste is turned into disturbing insects, a means to deeper thoughts.</image:caption>

It´s a fiction work that calls out the emotional struggles and insecurities that they are left to face alone, and so the purpose of this film is to show their side of the story and the slow motion of  their life hanging on the expectations of seeing their families again.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Pistols At Dawn - Please Report Anything Auspicious To A Member Of Staff</image:title>
            <image:caption>The London based band “Pistols At Dawn” recorded the protest song “Please Report Anything Auspicious To A Member Of Staff“ against the rise of the far right and xenophobia in answer to the Brexit referendum in June 2016. The title refers to the cherry-picking of 'worthy' immigrants, and also points to an Orwellian dystopia. The music video for the song was designed, animated and produced by Christian Hörlesberger in Vienna.

                The production took about 6 weeks in August and September 2016; the video was released on November-14-2016 on YouTube.

                The music video gets along without any edits. An animated cartoon version of Nigel Farage, former leader of the UKIP, walks along a road. He spreads empty promises; then he starts to sing the song. Gradually other cartoon versions of right-wing populists join (Heinz-Christian Strache, Marine Le Pen, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin). They sing the choruses together. During the video the environment gets darker and monotonously. At the end we find ourselves in a war zone.

                The video was brought to life with Adobe Character Animator. The software allows someone to animate Characters by using the webcam, touchpad and keyboard. It is still in development and is being tested.

                The band from London and the filmmaker from Vienna met at Radar Music Videos. On this internet platform for low budget music videos record labels and bands can put briefs online. Directors can pitch ideas and treatments for these briefs. The record labels and bands can choose one treatment and commission the filmmaker with the production of the video.</image:caption>

            <image:title>A MODERN LYNCHING</image:title>
            <image:caption>For my 8th grade English class, I needed to do a video based on things discussed on the Speak Truth To Power website about Human Rights. I decided I wanted to do it on police brutality and comparing it to another dark time in American history, lynching. After listening to several songs that dealt with the subject matter, I chose to use two songs that I felt best illustrated my feelings. They are STRANGE FRUIT by Billie Holiday and BE FREE by J. Cole. I actually obtained the rights to these songs after the license holders viewed the material. I also placed a Viewer Discretion Advised card at the opening to warn anyone who might be offended by the material. I hope it will open up dialogue and encourage people to think.</image:caption>

This is NOT an ordinary short film this is Outlet for the silent... this short shows how a victim still has a life to continue with outside of the domestic violence situation/relationship itself! In most situations there is still a child to care for, a job to worry about, the worrying family members who suspect something's wrong, and the get away plan that always crosses their mind but not always is executed successfully.</image:caption>

            <image:title>The Hunting Forest</image:title>
            <image:caption>This is my individual project for the course of Digital Animation Studio at Department of Digital Arts, Pratt Institute. I finished it in March 2016.

                I took charge of all the production processes in this project.

                The inspiration of this animated short film came from a chatting with my friend. In the modern society of information, people can easily get information from the internet. This makes us do less communications with each other face to face, and spend more and more time on our cellphones, laptops and computers. Except the adults, there is a serious phenomenon that most of children don't want to go outside to communicate with others, either, although they are at an energetic age that is suppose to led them to go outside to explore. They prefer stay at home to play video games. What's the world inside the mind of a child who always play with himself/herself? How the reflections of the real world look like in their mind?

                In this film, I created an exciting, mysterious and dangerous world inside a boy's brain. Let's enjoy the hunting game with him in the forest of mind.</image:caption>

                We have used iPhone 6plus 128GB model with fiLMIC Pro to shoot 100% of this movie. And used "Zhiyun-tech Z1 Smooth" gimbal for the smooth handheld shots. All done in available light and used only a reflector for some shots.

                STORY
                Robin. The last man on earth.
                He is following all the ruins on a land covered with dust and poisons. He is searching water, searching something to eat, but nowhere to survive. Mankind destroyed all the living things and they have killed themselves for years and years slowly.

                Now there is no earth, or there is no one for you to help when you
                realized the things you have done to mother earth.
                And she replied you back. It's time to say good-bye to mother earth.

                Because Robin has no shelter or no drinkable water or no way to be alive. His last breath will mix into the spammed and polluted air.

                If you rebirth again by a miracle,
                you may can look backward to rectify and correct your wrongful acts you have done to mother earth.
                But mother earth will not give you a second chance.

                You may rebirth and look back to correct your faults, its too late.
                Save earth.

                Because she protects you.
                But, Save her before she takes your life.

                END

                Plot -
                The endless needs of the mankind caused disruption. Disruption that destroys nature ignoring the fact that humans are a part of nature. Thus, as nature destroys... so will the mankind.
                Take a step back...think for a moment...if you are the last man to stand on earth...how will you ensure your survival? Will you be satisfied to live in a desert full of thorns?
                Even if you realize your mistakes at this point, there is no turning back. dreaming of a greener earth is possible, but...will this dream come true, if you ignore the causes of the climate changes?

                Enjoy the movie.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>‘Canvas’ is a short film, set in the current time period; about a young boy trying to live his life in his own terms. He does not wish to follow the age-old norms created by the society; he does not wish to live a mundane life. He wishes to be different and he is not afraid of the consequences. His dream to be a musician is mightier than all the hardships that he has to face. He tries to run away from the society, he suddenly discover a road where the trees seem to be alive, where the people welcomed him with colors; as if celebrating his newly earned independence. His passion, in the film, is represented by a woman who dares to look different. He returns to reality when his eyes open yet the surreal world seem to be calling him. The choice is between reality and surrealism. He chooses the latter.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Listen (Working Title)</image:title>
            <image:caption>Thank you for considering my screenplay. I hope you like what you read, and help me fund my project. I'm an independent artist, so every bit of encouragement, monetary and otherwise, helps me go a long way!

                "Listen" explores how perceptive and intuitive people are towards others who silently suffer from one or more forms of mental illness. The style of the script is close to how I operate in life - lace anything serious with some comedy, which feeds my non-confrontational nature. I think we've made great strides in conversations around issues like mental health, but it's still an uphill battle for some people. I intend to continue the great conversation we're having about this and encourage people to listen. Sometimes, we need to go beyond medicines, labels and an accurate diagnosis. We need people to listen. And help us validate that it's not "all in our heads".</image:caption>

            <image:title>LIFE IN KODACHROME</image:title>
            <image:caption>LIFE IN KODACHROME is the story of Carey Carpenter, an accomplished high-school senior who struggles to change the career path chosen for him in order to pursue his dream of racing hot rods.  In October 1957, Carey is at the drive-in with his best friends waiting for a movie to begin when the newsreel footage announces that the Russians have just launched Sputnik 1 into orbit.  It is the Dawn of the Space Age.  And it couldn't be a better time for those living in Southern California and working for one of the big three – Lockheed, Northrop, and Douglas – unless of course your passion is to design and build hot rod cars amongst the likes of Ed "Big Daddy" Roth, George Barris, and Von Dutch.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>A countless number of cameras and televisions in need of repair go through Miguel and David’s repair shops
                every day, with increasingly more complicated work needed. Following the path of these objects, we get to know these characters’ daily routine, whose life story evolve in the just as that of the things they’ve been repairing
                for decades. Objects that go unused and go from hand to hand every day, conquered by a diverse number of trades that give them new a new value to what is no longer usable for many people; until finally reaching a place
                where only fragments of each camera and television have their last chance.</image:caption>

It follows four friends through their journey from adolescence to adulthood and the hurdles they must overcome along the way.  Written as a narrative, you see how this realistic portrayal of life in Del Ray unfolds from the perspective of Griffin - one of the four best friends.  He reflects on the challenges he and his friends face in their community, their coping mechanisms, and the consequences and triumphs of their actions along the way. Jeff, Tim, Sean, and Griffin learn the importance of loyalty and friendship. As they unknowingly become father figures to each other, the question quickly becomes can they overcome the boundaries of a town that’s pushing them down before it’s too late?</image:caption>

            <image:title>DISRUPT</image:title>
            <image:caption>With 1 in 27 rapes reported, and the conviction rate for reported cases at between 8 and 14 percent, it is clear that South Africa is facing a crisis.

                After Rhodes University silenced the Chapter 2.12 campaign (which drew attention to rape culture on university campuses), students felt like their concerns were not heard.

                Tired of not being listened to, students decide to take matters into their own hands and compile a list of alleged rapists on campus. The list goes viral, and this sparks two weeks of protests and disruption including barricading the university, protesting topless to make a point, and police firing rubber bullets at and arresting students.

                Ultimately, the University obtains an interdict against the protesting students. While students have made their voices heard, this profound disruption of the status quo is brought to a halt, for now.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>John and Anna have been married for 10 years. How? Not sure. But that's just part of the joke in this slap-stick comedy that plays on the psychosis of the many personalities that are drawn to Hollywood and the entertainment industry from all corners of the world and all walks of life. John is a shlubby Jew from New York who moved to LA in hopes to be a producer while Anna, who moved to LA from Sydney, Australia is an actress. In reality, John is a computer programmer and Anna is a waitress. Their marriage is filled with debauchery and infidelity yet for reasons unknown they've stuck together through thick and thin. However, in recent years, they are starting to hit even rougher waters. They decide its time for therapy. That's where Doc comes in. Does he have a PhD? Probably not. Is he suitable to be giving life advice? My guess is "no." But he's the best chance they've got. A former musician, Doc had a wild time in his twenties. But now he's in his mid thirties and strapped with a wife and kid of his own and is already tired of his monotonous life. But he has to pay the bills some how, and music didn't do the trick. So he falls back on his bachelors in Psychology and opens up marriage councilors office. Through trying to help this helpless couple through their dysfunctional marriage our Doc's own internal demons are exposed and brought to the surface over the course of our therapy sessions. In the end he throws away all attempts at a traditional method of therapy and and uses a form of negotiations to appease both sides of this marriage. In the end everyone prevails, and the Doc is left beaten and exhausted, but happy he succeeded in saving yet another marriage in the city of Los Angeles.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>When Pierre Jr. is left alone at his family's particular parlor, he must figure out how to run this strange place by himself.

                Pierre's Particular Parlor of Pretentious Inventions(Pierre's, for short) is an experimental student short film I made as a part of my high school senior portfolio project. Pierre's was a project that was a bold and brave move for me, given how out of my normal style it was. It was also a pipe dream of a project, so the fact that it exists means so much to me. Pierre's is a film that will forever hold a special place in my heart, and I hope it holds that place in all of yours as well.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Heart of San Francisco</image:title>
            <image:caption>Through the eyes of a tourist, you get to see San Francisco from a different angle. It is A city famous for its beauty as well as its graffiti.  It is a city famous for the beautiful Golden Gate bridge, but it is also a city where the gap between the rich and poor is too great to bridge over.
                Even at the bottom of the last recession in 2009, San Francisco has had 138,300 households with over 1 million in assets.  Housing prices may have been lifted back to the pre-recession high, but there are still people who struggle to live under the shadow of  the skyrocketing housing prices. To some who live there, San Francisco is a just a city someone else calls home.

                In a city where even a million dollars can’t buy you a median priced home, there are only a few things you can have for free - the California sunshine, the fog over Golden Gate, and the free show at Pier 39.  Let’s meet someone who was abandoned at birth, adopted at age 10, ran away from home at age 15, and lived and performed on the street but got himself through college. He is the man who is able to put a smile on everyone’s face.

                Lynx may not have much, but he has enough to share.   Other than the thanks and the occasional tip, his best reward is to see smiles on everyone’s faces.  It is a luxury he did not have while growing up, but instead of mourning for what he lost, he decided to give back what was taken from him.
                You don’t have to be a millionarie to be happy, just like you don’t need to have money to be rich.  Lynx showed us that success is not measured by the size of your bank account, but how much love fills from the heart.</image:caption>

                In a dog forsaken city like Los Angeles, animals of every kind flock for a chance at fame and fortune. Unfortunately, Hollywood ain't a pet friendly town. That's where Katniss Klaw, Rex Pinscher, Detective Mike, and Brittany; The Los Angeles Pet Squad, step in. Abusive set wrangler? Contract issues with your kitty litter sponsor? Diamond studded collar stolen? Catnip addiction? L.A.P.S. has seen it all and will stop at nothing to make sure every dog has its day and every kitten is purring.

                LAPS is a zero budget pilot.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Two Rivers</image:title>
            <image:caption>Two Rivers is a story about the destructive relationship between Dirke (Mark Borchardt) and Emma (Melonie Gartner). Dirke is a troubled individual who can’t hold down a job. Haunted by his own demons and coupled with an explosive temper, Dirke is a force to be reckoned with.

                Dirke’s uncontrollable attitude also spills into his relationship with Emma, a long-suffering woman. Dirke’s abusive way leaves her cold and broken. Emma neither has anything left to give to their relationship nor any place nor means to escape her situation. She fears and resents Dirke. Her feelings don’t go unnoticed – Dirke can feel Emma is slipping away from him. The thought that he cannot control her feelings makes him out of control all the more.

                Two Rivers represents two bodies of water that can’t be merged. It’s Dirke and Emma’s Mesopotamia. A tale of tainted love that has gone past the point of no return.</image:caption>

                “Mordred”, is a gritty Arthurian drama, telling the legends from the point of view of Arthur’s much vilified illegitimate son, set in the 6th Century, drawing heavily from very early sources, including the Annales Cambriae, the Welsh Triads, the Mabinogion, and local legends in Devon &amp; Cornwall, as well as more recent medieval sources. This drama is set in the 530s, against the backdrop of the Saxon invasions, heavily influenced by Celtic legends, Druidic traditions, and the earliest tales of Arthur, and his followers.



                The South Devon Players Theatre &amp; Film Company, are a team who have run in South Devon, England, since 2005-6. Founded to create theatre shows based on history and legends, we have more recently expanded into film as well,

            <image:title>Racing Through The Forest</image:title>
            <image:caption>A documentary film produced by renowned racecar driver Rick Knoop and filmmaker Dean Kirkland entitled, “Racing Through the Forest – The History of the 1950-56 Pebble Beach Road Races”.




                The documentary was filmed over approximately three years and includes 50 interviews of legendary names in road racing such as Fred Knoop, Mick Marston, Bill Pollack, Jim Hall and Phil Remington. It chronicles the events from the first through the last Pebble Beach Road Races, which included legends like Carroll Shelby, Phil Hill and Bill Pollock in 1956.




                “What began as a tribute to my father, Fred Knoop, has evolved into a celebration of one of the world’s greatest road races,” said Knoop. “We’re thrilled to share this incredible story with audiences at the Pebble Beach Concours. It is a privilege to have the opportunity to explore this incredible history, especially just feet from the road where the men and machines did battle. I’m honored that some of those featured in the film have committed to attend.”




                "We're pleased to host the premiere screening of ‘Racing Through the Forest’, which focuses on the Pebble Beach Road Races and enthusiasts who started and participated in these sporting yet fierce competitions,” said Sandra Button, Chairman of the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. "We all owe a great debt to these enthusiasts. I'm certain that much of the collector car world today would not exist without them. And there would be many fewer ways to see and celebrate great cars and the people affiliated with them."




                Inspired by the memoirs of the Del Monte Forest Road Race history, the Pebble Beach Concours and Pebble Beach Company teamed up with K&amp;K Productions to preview the documentary for a select audience. Blending interviews with racers and incredible footage of the events, the film recalls the glories of this oft forgotten race with a video archive of its history.</image:caption>

            <image:title>"Evil From The Outset?" Trailer/Titles</image:title>
            <image:caption>In the beginning he was abandoned by his father Dick Arbitrage Jr., set adrift in a basket like the baby Moses of biblical lore, and later taken in by senior fellows of a prominent neoconservative think tank. What kind of upbringing was this to be for the young lad? Many who knew Edmund Emil Harbinger from his younger days saw a confused boy, surrounded by money, opulence and privilege, yet subject to extremely doctrinaire care-givers and daily readings from Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged.” This documentary carefully examines the formative stuff that various third-person testimonials identify as key ingredients in the making of a monster.

                Edmund Harbinger fatally shot both of his neoconservative care-givers with a certain nonchalance, later telling police that he wanted to know what it felt like “to make a killing.” These tragic events led to his interment in the St. Affluenza Psychiatric Hospital for the elite insane. There the 15 year old Harbinger ingratiated himself to the psychiatric staff who dealt with all manner of “market-driven mental maladies.” He became a trusted assistant, and after a mere five years in the hospital Harbinger, now six feet nine inches tall and close to three hundred pounds, was released.

                Subsequently a string of C.E.O.s and hedge fund managers were brutally slain, culminating with the murder of Harbinger’s birth father Dick Arbitrage Jr. Thankfully for all concerned Dick’s badly murdered head was swiftly placed into cryonic freeze, in hopes that one day he may be revived and his hedge fund managing resumed. This documentary poses the classic nature versus nurture question: was Harbinger the product of his upbringing within the secret confines of the neoconservative “American Heritage Institute?” Or indeed, was this serial killer, dubbed by the media “the C.E.O. Butcher,” simply “Evil From The Outset?”

                Opinions are divided. Robert T. Morrow, the intrepid reporter from the “Sagaponack Sentinel” who worked the case, is convinced that Harbinger “would have given anything to be a normal person.” Likewise Dr. Lawrence McPhail, a Psychiatrist from St. Affluenza who befriended the young Harbinger, stated that there was “no part of him that was happy with what he wound up doing.” Contrary to this Detectives Dickerson and Stroker described Harbinger as a “sociopathic asshole” and a “loser shit head.” Finally, after all is said and done, it is up to the judgment of our “true-crime” documentary audience to decide if Harbinger was indeed “evil from the outset!”</image:caption>

                Trigger warning (pun)! There are girls with guns in this video. If you are offended by hunting, shooting, farm animals, girls, babies, or the great outdoors, consider yourself warned - but you should still watch, because this is Brooklyn's favorite episode so far.

                In this episode, Brooklyn visits a friend's farm in Tehachapi and hunts rabbits - without much success. Also, there are haunted houses!</image:caption>

                Written by: Jarrod A Knowles

                "What is Art?

                Is it just Expression... or something more...

                Is it the Extraordinary feeling of Creating Wonders...

                Or the Pride of accomplishing the Unique.

                Some say it's simply a Manifestation of a Vision...

                We say... its the Journey...

                to make that Vision you see in your Mind,

                become the Reality we see, with our eyes"</image:caption>

                BLOODY HAMMER FILMS STRIKES AGAIN! Gore, sadism, sex, violence, gruesome exploitation at its finest! Bloody Hammer Films' entry for the 2013 48 Hour Film Festival just didn't seem right at its 7 minute version... so we made it 18 minutes instead! That's 11 more minutes of NUDITY, BLOOD, GUTS, PAIN, BONDAGE, VOMIT, BOOBS, FIRE, AND GUNS!

                Set in an unnamed town in an unknown part of the country, outlaw biker Logan O'Brien brings his son with him on a "business trip" of an ambiguous nature. What was meant to be a father-son trip soon turns into a bloodbath when the saloon they travel to turns out to be bait for unsuspecting wanderers who are tortured sadistically and killed by the bar staff! What happens next? Only the complete maniacs at Bloody Hammer Films know... until you watch it!

                Jesus' homoerotic final days are relived on the silver screen, where lust, jealousy, and homophobia are revealed to be the real motives behind his execution!

                Gay Jesus is Paul M McAlarney and Ungovernable Films' answer to the homophobic attitudes running rampant in large sectors of the Christian Church. With gratuitous nudity, gore, and sex, offensive and tasteless dialogue, and all your favorite mythological characters from the Bible, Gay Jesus will have you pitching a tent next time you're at Sunday Mass!

            <image:title>A Box Came To Brooklyn</image:title>
            <image:caption>It’s a quiet Sunday morning in an up-and-coming Brooklyn neighborhood. Naïve man-child Johnny stumbles upon an anonymous box in the middle of his dead-end block. The other residents of Schenectady Street gather to nervously investigate. What’s in it, and who left it? Good-natured Steve struggles to be the voice of reason as local loudmouth Charlie fans the flames of post-9/11 paranoia. Speculation turns to accusation as prejudices and crackpot theories turn neighbor against neighbor. Is Johnny’s farfetched story about the box correct, or is there an even more fiendish plot behind it all?</image:caption>

            <image:title>Deadline (Original Version)</image:title>
            <image:caption>From the writer and director of The Floridian Heat, comes a thriller with killer ambitions. Deadline follows the story of a college student named Ariel, who gets shunned out by her classmates for creating a script within a genre that's outside the standard course objectives. She's then forced to pick a different genre, and chooses to create a story around the thriller genre. With little time on her hands to come up with ideas, she decides that killing her classmates will help her craft the story she plans to make. Deadline is a smart, funny, and suspenseful twist on the thriller genre while painting a loving homage to classic cinema.

                Deadline is a non-profit short feature made at The University of Tampa for COM 460 Senior Seminar Film/Digital Production</image:caption>

                The images are everywhere, and nature is the greatest artist. Photography is strongly connected to nature, we can say it comes from nature.  photography contains an element of magic, particularly the pinhole photography. Camera obscura phenomenon occurs spontaneously in nature, it creates the most realistic projections, and using them you can get the most interesting illusions. Nature controls the process of seeing, through manipulating light and shadow. From the one side, i am giving tribute to nature by allowing her creation mobile projection and documenting them, on the other hand, I try to change the course of things and take control over the process of view. Using the white and black paint, I once hide and another time shows the projections of nature. I try to show the magical aspect of nature and using white paint create my own color moving picture of reality. Freely changing angle, focus, I overstretching and resizing, using paints I give it a new framework. I am playing with nature.</image:caption>

            <image:title>The Real Dreams</image:title>
            <image:caption>The film consists of time-lapse images taken in different spaces converted into camera obscura. These are: the iglo, hunting pulpit, cave, tent, boat and caravan. Just like in the rest of my projects based on the action of camera obscura phenomenon, I try to show the magical aspect of photography. It occurs spontaneously in nature and is omnipresent. Just inside the closed, darkened space you need to create a small hole to be able to admire, moving projections of reality. External view of the world designed inverted inside the room, so two spaces merge into one extraordinary image. I selected the spaces which are partly the shelters. When I am hide inside, at the same time i am an observer of the outside world and i am the background to the projection of nature. It is, in a sense, work about me, about my deep connection with nature. While inside the space, in which full is amazing play of light, it feels like in a magic world. It is very unusual that the images, although they are overstretched and reversed, still remain realistic, and when I connect with them, I feel safe as in a dream.</image:caption>

                After hiding in the dry leaves, Bahar and Udin heared all the discourse about the gang that wanted to attack on army’s Barrack. Bahar slowly out of a pile of dry leaves and followed by Udin. Bahar even glance towards Udin signaled by raising an eyebrow, with their retreat was slowly creeping out of its hiding place and stood back up, he settles - sneaked in the side away from the hordes.

                While walking, they mutually praised each other, amid talked Bahar said that he will face the commanders. Udin suddenly stalled while thinking, surprised, and confused. Then Udin said, "Then you will be promoted?" Starting from the Udin sentence conflict arises amid their trip.

His adulterating wife, dead beat son and know-it-all daughter have become too much for Tommy to take as he resorts to his alter-ego that exists somewhere in the dark, twisted abyss that is Tommy's mind. Most of us can control the switch that prevents us from making irrational, regretful decisions; the question is, can Tommy?</image:caption>

            <image:caption>One in three people will suffer from heart disease in their lifetime, but only one in a million will thrive from it. HEART: Flatline to Finish Line® is the raw and emotional journey of six individuals from hospital beds to the finish line of one of the world’s most grueling endurance events, the IRONMAN® triathlon.

                Director David Watkins flatlined on the operating table- his heart stopped for 5 minutes. For an otherwise healthy man in his thirties, a congenital heart defect nearly proved fatal. After being revived and surviving a subsequent stroke, he became determined to do something with his second lease on life.

                Heart surgery is an all too common event. Before long David was meeting people from around the world with similar stories. All had something to prove. This is the story of 6 survivors daring to take on an improbable feat and prove to the world they still have the heart to overcome any obstacle that gets in their way.

                This feature-length documentary will take you on a journey of despair and triumph, of sacrifice and glory. Featuring original music by indie darling Cloud Cult, and interviews with some of the biggest names in endurance sport and cardiology, it will inspire you to examine your own life and encourage you to fill it full of HEART.</image:caption>

                Purplehed Burn Like The Sun (Official Video)
                Remembering Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam (a tribute to the former President of India)
                Presenting an Inspirational and motivational upbeat Pop song by Purplehed.

                Synopsis of Music Video:
                A young man who is contemplating on Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, heads out for a run. In his mind he visualizes the struggles of two chained imaginary characters that represent Men and Women around. He comes across various people. His mind gives him illusions of an imaginary chain that represents barriers around people, he comes across. The imaginary characters in his mind continue to depict the nature of struggle and the pain people go through. The turmoil in his head keeps on increasing and the person keeps running faster and faster till he gets visions of these people breaking their chains. The journey of breaking these chains is powered by education and karma. Once the shackles are broken, the guy feels liberated and is set to find an ecstasy that he never thought was attainable in destiny. This ecstasy is portrayed through the joyous dance movements of imaginary characters in his mind and his uninhibited run. His body, mind &amp; soul have let go of all chains.


                Lyrics:
                You and I, are torn apart
                Desire, burns in our hearts
                Walls of fear, cage our dreams
                We'll break these walls, just you and me
                Aooooooo, Aoooooooo .....


                Away from bars away from chains
                Away from lives lived in vain
                Where we will be set free
                to break all trends and just be

                Lets fly away
                Let's go make our escape
                Let's dream dream dream
                Our dreams transcend

                Alive and awake,
                We'll rise and shine today
                And burn like the sun
                We'll light the dark away


                Way up high, the nerves diffuse
                There's no ground, to feel the blues
                Beyond the fear, dreams fly free
                We'll make them last, just you and me
                Aaooooooo, Aaoooooo.

                We feel no fear, we feel no pain
                We take the fall we rise again
                Till we ride an ecstasy
                Ecstasy we want we need

                We'll find a perfect place
                Where troubles fade away
                Lets dream dream dream
                Our dreams transcend

                Alive and awake,

                We'll rise and shine today
                And burn like the sun, We will light the Dark Away
                Burn like the sun
                Burn like the sun

                Karmanye Vadhikaraste, Ma phaleshou kada chana
                Ma Karma Phala Hetur Bhur, matey Sangostva Akarmani (Sanskrit ?loka)

                Burn like the sun (Repeat)
                Light the dark away


                Sanskrit ?loka from the Bhagwad Gita – chapter 2 verse 47 –
                English Translation: “You can work for it, it is your right but you can not claim your right on the fruits. The fruits of action should not be your motive nor should you be attached to inaction."</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Oro is falling from the sky into a desert world...
                All around him, dark shapes are raising from everywhere and are turning into supernatural creatures and into samurais. A terrible fight is about to begin between the warriors and the creatures that look like diabolical octopuses.
                And then the dark shapes are becoming brightly colored creatures, psychedelic octopuses that are moving restlessly and excitedly, but then menacingly.

                As if totally indifferent to what happens around him, Oro is rambling into this chaotic background, from scenes of fear to scenes of contemplation .
                Can he get out of here ?
                Are these strange octopuses really a threat ?

                What if Oro was himself the creator of this world ?</image:caption>

                Trigger warning (pun)! There are girls with guns in this video. If you are offended by hunting, shooting, farm animals, girls, babies, or the great outdoors, consider yourself warned - but you should still watch, because this is Brooklyn's favorite episode so far.

                In this episode, Brooklyn visits a friend's farm in Tehachapi and hunts rabbits - without much success. Also, there are haunted houses!</image:caption>

            <image:caption>I love cows and have worked and lived with them a fair bit. I stumbled on this friendly herd in Spring of this year, when I was on the outskirts of town in search of a visiting yearling moose in the vicinity. After our moose neighbour moved on in June, I visited with these guys- trying to get some nice footage of a beautiful subject, but also just to spend time with this lovely group. They've been most gracious, greeting me and hanging out even though all I brought them was me. I've greatly enjoyed the time they've allowed me to spend in their company thus far. So much so that, one rather hot day quite recently, I walked from the outskirts of one end of town to the outskirts on their end of town to see them. Great to see the new arrival and I expect there will be more- I'll be back, you guys. :)

            <image:title>True Friends Alternative with no transitions or jump cuts</image:title>
            <image:caption>This is the alternative or a different version of my 3rd directional venture. The first half is a bit different from the previous version while the 2nd half stays the same. The story is influenced by a scene from the Romantic Drama Malayalam movie Niram. A 1999 movie directed by Kamal. It stars Baby Shalini(adult in the film) and Kunchacko Boban. I liked that scene really much because it showed a message to me and maybe to everyone. I wrote the story in a way I can show that scene again showing the true message of True Friends! I think everyone who has seen Niram might be able to tell which scene it is. Hope all of you will enjoy this. Please Ignore and excuse my puffy or tired face, I was under a tight schedule due to college. Also, it was hard to have the entire cast in one day since they are also busy with their things. No wonder why casting directors and managers are there for! I wish I could make this a bit longer but due to time limit no! not happening!

                Remember Friendship is a blessing it doesn't matter what nationality, gender, or what religion you are, It is a great gift from God and it is a beautiful experience for us human beings as long as it is with good people.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Dick And Jack" - It is our fathers who show us how to navigate the world. Joe Kennedy the father of Jack pushed his son into the presidency he himself could not attain. And Frank Nixon, the father of Dick, taught his son to hate which in politics is a form of navigation.

                Dick and Jack takes place before JFK’s election in 1960 while Nixon was Vice-President and the two were still friends. The film concludes with Kennedy as President who no longer seeks his father’s help. Needing to shape others, Joe replaces Frank as Dick’s father. Nixon wisely learns under the tutelage of his new father how to temper his hate and achieve the presidency in 1968.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Imminent</image:title>
            <image:caption>“Imminent” is a short experimental narrative, that gives a futuristic scenario about the ‘Human
                Communication’. The film predicts how our present; where everything is becoming digital and the
                virtual presence/communication is dominating our lives, and slowly becoming more important than
                the real life communication; is going to shape our future. Jamal lives in the year 2389, where
                everyone is connected through a virtual world, and he has never experienced real ‘face-to-face’
                communication with anyone. Therefor, he gets to a point where he cant live like that anymore, and
                decides to commit suicide virtually, leaving a suicide note behind.</image:caption>

Drastically after-toned with the noises of killer plays, the brutality of the pictures is exaggerated. The last traffic victim, a recently died Red-legges Partridge *, was picked up, prepared as freshly hunted and consumed afterwards. By the transformation this cadaver into a delicate-eat becomes the unbelievable ignoring of the life clearly, which daily takes place on all roads. The video shows also the strange instilled differentiation between hunted, thus to the consumption killed and from traffic crushed animals.

            <image:caption>Tasmina, an eleven years old girl of a remote village in Northern Bangladesh is known as ‘Horse Girl’ in her neighborhood. Where more than sixty percent of the girls are married off before their 15th birthday, Tasmina aspires to ride horse and join horse races at least for another five years. In this rural society outdoor games are not allowed for the ‘grown up’ women and horse race is unthinkable. Thanks to Tasmina’s parents, they think that she could play the game for two more years.
                Earlier Tasmina used to join the races riding other people’s horse. She won several competitions but didn’t get the prize money or the awards. Owner of the horse took away everything, giving her a little amount. Her father bought a small horse for her.  But this tiny little horse can’t cope with the big racing horses and she can’t fight back with all her elder male competitors.</image:caption>

                A father takes his son fishing in order to make him a man, using fishing as a right of passage. The film symbolically deals with notions of masculinity, both what the gender role of heteronormative masculinity entails, and why violence seems rooted in this binary notion of manhood.
                This film was shot on the Blackmagic Cinema Camera 2.5K. It was made as the end of the year project for the Filmmaking II course and Concordia University's Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema.</image:caption>

            <image:title>The Trouble With Rain Official Trailer</image:title>
            <image:caption>Miller (Erik Nelson) just misses his train to Chattanooga one steamy afternoon. While waiting on the next train he meets three strangers – Eric (Adam Sanner), Constance (Valerie Jane Parker) and Violet (Inge Uys). Will these four young professionals become friends, lovers; or will they simply go their separate ways and never see each other again? Like Schrodinger’s Cat, all of the possible outcomes of this chance encounter are equally real, but only one will come to pass. Or will it?
                The story line is non-linear (almost a Twilight Zone-esque kind of feel) that moves back and forth in time over a six year period. These four strangers who meet by happenstance at a train station, are ‘called back’ to the train station to relive that initial meeting, where slightly different actions result in sometimes drastically altered futures. The decisions they make, the words they speak and the actions they take during this initial meeting dictate how their future relationships play out. The ‘moral of the story’ (if you will) is that all of our actions, even the smallest, have consequences – for good or for ill.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>The story of “a true artist without professional patronage” had been created for many years and in many places. The first stage took place in 1999-2000, when the audio version of the finished text was produced. The material was then repeatedly processed and edited. Finally the picture was produced, as planned from the very beginning. The text has been created in Vienna, the soundtrack in Szczecin, the video in Berlin.

                The project is the result of work by a group whose members have never met together in full. Bartosz Wójcik is the author of the idea and of the text. The creations of Piotr Klimek, responsible for the soundtrack, and Micha? Kosakowski, who made the video are, however, original in their nature.</image:caption>

            <image:title>The Last Tram</image:title>
            <image:caption>The last tram of the day enters the terminus at midnight, every night. Its only passengers are a toy salesman, a beggar woman, and an extremely handsome, well-dressed gentleman. He carries a distinctive briefcase with golden coin-shaped patterns. Every night, the mysterious gentleman visits a woman; a woman gaudy in her dress sense, frivolous in her manner and conspicuously foolish.
                The man opens his enigmatic briefcase in front of the woman, takes out a pouch full of gold coins and shakes them. He also opens a blue diary and reads out passages. The desperate woman disrobes herself and flings her saree at the man. Before the crack of dawn, the man departs. He returns the next night, taking the same tram. He traverses the same narrow bylanes to reach the same woman. He shakes the pouch full of coins again. When the woman reaches out to ask for the coins, the man gives her a pair of binoculars. She wants to discover a new, more colourful world by looking into the binoculars. The man, however, leaves her for another woman. Like he did with the previous woman, he opens his briefcase to shake the pouch full of coins and offer the binoculars. This woman rejects the proffered binoculars and demands the coins. The man gives them to her. His illusions are all but broken. He understands that all that appeals to this woman are the coins and not him, the person. He remembers the previous woman, who, knowing that she will not get anything out of it, still loved him earnestly. He wants to go back to her, but it is too late, he has been ensnared by the trap he laid out himself. Hiding his face behind dark blue glasses, he gets on to the the last tram. The smoky tram navigates a dream-like landscape. Behind it, dressed like a bride, runs the foolish woman. The idiot girl, runs after the last tram in a fruitless quest for the infinite.</image:caption>

After a rather foreboding conversation with one of her friends involving recent disappearances in the area, and an old Native American boarding school that was burned down, she settles in to a seemingly hum-drum close of day, and eventually goes to bed.

                Her slumbers don’t last long however, and she wakes after a terrifying dream. Things take a horrifying turn for the worse as it becomes more apparent that someone – or something – has crept into her apartment. Visit the website: http://visitor-film.com.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Trailer SERES - dance film (2016)</image:title>
            <image:caption>SERES is a different concept of a different time, where the past coexists with the future. A mystery arises where the instinctive and rational, the conscious and the unconscious, the music and the dance, are embodied in two beings. This encounter resonates in its environment, merging with it. Here, the interpretation is open: Is it the movement of the bodies that creates the music or is it the music that causes the movement? Is it the music that represents the nature that surrounds it, or is it the nature that makes the music emerge? The questions arise in a poem that turns on itself in an essentialism full of metaphors.</image:caption>

                You're highness
                Lyrics by Moran Levi

                You’re the king of the world
                Better than all boys and girls
                You’re a woman, you’re old
                Once you’re weak, than you’re strong

                You're everything you want
                My love, again you hurt
                Your own things, your mother's heart
                Cause once again the madness starts

                If I could help you to see
                You're highness
                If I could give you normal life
                But you are strong now

                You are the most loving baby
                The greatest of all maybe
                You are a pure soul on earth
                And no one can match you worth

                You're everything you want
                My love, again you hurt
                Your own things, your mother's heart
                Cause once again the madness starts



                He himself doesn’t understand his struggles
                I wonder how his little body handles this.
                And I wish I could be his angel
                Cause his smile is what I miss

            <image:title>Banana Pearl</image:title>
            <image:caption>Long Log line:
                After failing to deliver an apparently un-crackable code, Deejay and his computer-whiz acid casualty mate Lenny end up on the run from Champagne Charlie, a ruthless gangster known for her quirky methods of coercion.
                This is a fast-paced slice of Brit-gangster mayhem in which things aren't always what they seem.

                Short Synopsis - 123 words
                Made on a shoe string budget by up-and-coming Brighton based filmmaker Ben Simon, Banana Pearl feels like a much higher budget short. Featuring performances from Saffron Sprackling, front women of 90's Brit-pop band Republica and Toby Osmond (Kaufman's Game), this is a race against time tale of 2 friends trying to break an apparently un-crackable code for Champaign Charlie (played by Saffron) a ruthless local gangster. If Deejay can keep Lenny, his computer-whiz, acid casualty mate off the Banana Pearl (a new strain of super strong Marijuana) and focus on cracking the code, they can both avoid finding out how Champagne Charlie earned her nickname.
                Boasting a pumping soundtrack, this is a fast-paced slice of Brit-gangster mayhem in which things aren't always what they seem.</image:caption>

            <image:title>A Dancer who gave up</image:title>
            <image:caption>UNESCO's Intangible Heritage Program recognizes dance as an essential source of identity, deeply rooted in the past. Unfortunately, the fluid, undocumented form of many traditional dance forms makes them particularly vulnerable in situations of rapid change and socio-political upheaval.More of it , most of the dancers who are the living form of carrying this heritage and cultural expression gave up due up to the lack of resources which arises of changing employment condition , livelihood pressure and falling down in employability. This is a story of one such dancer from a small town of Bengal , who gave up dancing due to financial pressure.</image:caption>

            <image:title>The Ungovernable Force (2016) OFFICIAL TRAILER</image:title>
            <image:caption>***If you are a film critic or operate a film review website/blog and would like to see the entire film for review, please email ungovernablefilms@gmail.com. The same goes for any other inquiries. Enjoy!

                "The Ungovernable Force" takes the raw gross-out b-horror humor of "Street Trash" and fuses it with the subculture-exploiting theme of "Suburbia"; add to that the very tangible plot line of bums (not unlike those in "Street Trash") teaming up with punks (not unlike those in "Suburbia") to fight a sadistic sheriff running for mayor on the American Fascist Party platform. Just when you thought "All cops are bastards" and other overused punk cliches couldn't possibly be used any more liberally, "The Ungovernable Force" comes tumbling off the big silver screen with abundant and unnecessary nudity, violence, shock, gore, obscenity, profanity, controversy, taboo, drugs, sex, cop-killing, punk rock fun! With a killer soundtrack and unforgettable appearances from punk and b-horror legends [Tony Moran (John Carpenter's "Halloween"), Bill Weeden (Troma's "Sgt. Kabukiman"), Lloyd Kaufman, Debbie Rochon (1990's "Scream Queen of the Decade"), Apache Ramos ("The Warriors"), Nic Cramer (Award-Winning Porn Director), Nick Cash (999), Steve Ignorant (CRASS), Shend (The Cravats), Steve Lake (Zounds), Zillah Minx (Rubella Ballet), Mensi (Angelic Upstarts)], "The Ungovernable Force" takes every taboo and offensive element of society and forces it down the audience's throat, all while spoon-feeding the tortured audience a splendid tale of heartbreak, romance, and a coming-of-age drama between close friends, set against a punk and bum backdrop!</image:caption>

Grampy reveals things at the age of 77 that he has never told anyone in his entire life. 'A lot of people have no idea what goes on behind closed doors... I just felt, at my time of life, the time had come to say something about it. Weather its important to anyone or not... I don't know. But those who are interested will know...what happened.'

                Grampy, (Eric Galvani) was evacuated from Liverpool at the age of 5 during WW2. Having already lost his mother, he was taken from the rest of his family and moved around the countryside. However, the worst was yet to come. A poverty-stricken post war Liverpool was waiting for him at the end of the war, and so were his bitter stepmother and volatile father. The youngest of 8 children, Eric faced a hungry childhood which might take his whole life to come to terms with. 'The adults who were supposed to act in my interest... I would say to them, Look at me and speak to me, as if I'm a fellow human being...not turn your back and ignore me as you might do a dog that's running round on the floor.'</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Hikari, Ayumu, and Reina are three children who have been living in self-constructed castles of the heart.
                Surrounded by walls, not letting anyone in, and not leaving themselves, the worlds were supposed to be complete.
                But they are pulled together by invisible threads, becoming entwined, and are lead to another world.
                With music from Iceland's Sigur Rós, this is a child ensemble drama portraying children's lies from the perspective of children.

                The three inside their castles are slowly drawn together by invisible threads.

                The girl who was pretending to be unable to see becomes able to, the boy who was pretending to be able to see confesses
                that he can't, and the girl who was convinced she could see realizes that she can't.

            <image:title>The Hopping Dead</image:title>
            <image:caption>SYNOPSIS: Two thieves break into a Chinese business only to stumble upon the terror that is the Chinese jiang shi, a corpse reanimated as a vampire by Chinese black magic that, because of rigor mortis, chases after its victims by hopping.

                DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT:
                There is more to Asian culture than just kung fu. There is also… hopping vampires. I have loved the idea of hopping vampires ever since I saw the quintessential jiang shi movie “Mr. Vampire” as a child. With this film, I wanted to bring my own jiang shi story to life while paying tribute the two filmmakers who have influenced me the most: the legendary Sammo Hung and the Master of Terror John Carpenter. And like I told my last wife, I says, “Honey, I never drive faster than I can see. Besides that, it’s all in the reflexes.”</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Whyaye Productions presents BABY GIRL featuring Shadow Intimates fashion line.
                Baby Girl pays homage to Spike Lee’s classic ‘She’s Gotta Have It’ - the film that addresses social issues whilst telling the story of a girl that wants it all. The film borrows from the 1990s New York aesthetic as a tribute to the director.
                The film shows you bondage like you’ve never seen before - combining straps, chokers and harnesses with softer and safer materials. Just like the protagonist in the film ‘She’s Gotta Have It’ it shows that women no longer needs to decide if they want raunchy or casual, because having it all is possible.</image:caption>

The heavy rain was the main theme of the afternoon for him. People past by, but no one paid attention to him. He was alone and survived in his own way with humbly contribution.

                Different life was separated from the two sides of the window. Who could explain it in one word?</image:caption>

                -BK

                'Wound Wound Round' is an excerpt from '26 Suicides'.

                26 Suicides is a 27 chapter, non-narrative new media art work.

                **26 Suicides was initially designed to use surround sound and multi channel video to deliver an enveloping, synesthetic experience. 26 Suicides is currently being remixed as a virtual reality art experience.**

                It is the personal and intimate testimony of BK's synesthetic life.

            <image:title>Five Nights of Waking Dreams</image:title>
            <image:caption>Produced By:

                KraZy KiDD TeLepRDucTionS Created from an original concept by:

                David B. Cartwright and Steve Kusaba

                Soundtrack Composed By:

                Steve Kusaba

                Featuring :

                Alex Ferris and Anarchestra

                Featuring the Poetry of: Daniel Moore


                Five Nights of Waking Dreams is a pseudo psychedelic tight rope walk over fire. Teetering between the thin parameters between reality and illusion bringing viewers to the intersecting spaces where the parameters that define our perception of both continuous states of our minds existence blurring the lines between dream and reality, heaven and hell, pain and pleasure, through a period of Five Nights of Waking Dreams.


                The film invites you to experience the world through the mental perspective of a neurological condition that effects the circadian rhythm and causes the most severe pain known to modern medicine. A prolonged cycle of sleep deprivation and pain trapped in a rotation between heaven and hell, dead clarity and hallucination.


                The accompanying, mesmerizing, baroque rock sounds of the prolific composer of “Centrifugal Satz Clock” (the worlds largest musical collection ever) Steve Kusaba adds layers and dimensions to this visceral, prolific, experience.</image:caption>

                The step doesn't seems high but with huge differences. Perhaps in somewhere not been seen, the distance between some people and this world is formed with accumulated hatred and become a huge invisible wall.</image:caption>

            <image:title>The World of Prosperity</image:title>
            <image:caption>The World of Prosperity is an experiment to construct architecture which disguises evil as good. It is the projection of an architectural wolf in sheep´s clothing.

                The project investigates the current sins of capitalism such as the fortification of the urban landscape, omnipresent surveillance, gentrification and eviction of the socially-disadvantaged from public space, and excessive use of euphemisms in the architectural language.

                These characteristics are extrapolated into a dystopian near-future scenario within post-crises London, the world´s financial hub.

                The story´s thematic object - the cyborg pigeon - embodies the role of passive surveillance and acts as a corrective agent within the public space. It symbolises resilient capitalist dynamics, which strive to achieve higher efficiency while remaining disguised.

                The ambiguity stretches throughout the project. Colourful visuals combine with engaging language to create an impression of a Disneyland-like promotional ad. This is contrasted with the sinister references scattered throughout the animation.

                The World of Prosperity is an investigation of the ambiguity of architecture in pseudo-post-capitalist society.</image:caption>

                Jiang Xiao, a graduating student who is deeply influenced by the Chinese mainstream education system, decided to record the entire production process of Lan's mockumentary as his final project before graduation.
                In order to present a splendid film, some extreme means were implemented by Lan Hai during the production. However, Lan Hai felt guilty as the leading actress (MIN) died during the production.
                The whole process was recorded by Jiang Xiao. He strongly condemned Lan Hai’s extreme way of film production.
                In fact, there was an ugly evil deep within Jiang Xiao, which was behind the mask of morality.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Day Zero: Behind the Frame</image:title>
            <image:caption>"Day Zero: Behind the Frame" takes us through an intimate journey into life on set of the second season of "Day Zero" the Series, an independent web TV production that won over 40 film awards over a span of just a few years, rising to the top of the indie scene with long-format episodes rivaling Hollywood television, not just in length, but in style and presentation. It is a poster example of Utah's growing filmmaking industry that lays the foundation and groundwork as a renown pioneer for passion projects. This behind-the-scenes look into the show makes the case as the first long-running television production without a budget, that pushes the envelope to what is possible, rendering a once ambitious and daunting project replete with scheduling conflicts and delays, to become a completed product of twenty half-hour episodes with all the bells and whistles that entertain and provoke thought and insight into a post-apocalyptic disaster scenario.

                (logline)

                Is such experience false, where the spaces begin to diminish, reduce and separate?

                (synopsis)

                Twenty years ago, Mr. Dedi?, a professional Cellist with his career on the rise suddenly decided to stop playing the Cello, and withdrew from the world.

                After leaving the Philharmonic orchestra, without anything, only his cello, various psychiatric institutions became his home, until he finally arrived at a sanatorium at the top of the mountain named Avala.

                In this displaced and forgotten psychiatric asylum, also known as Open Day Hospital, he is waiting for a return to the real world.

                The only staff in the forgotten hospital, marked out for demolition, is the head nurse Sonja, who is also a housekeeper and a therapist. Mr. Dedi? is her only remaining patient.

                Days are going slowly, like in every hospital. Mainly, Mr. Dedi? is fighting his own demons. When he cannot sleep, he dreams of and imagines war crimes for which he is being told never happened. He feels sick remorse, since his music could not prevent all those atrocities.

                After one experience with Sonja, during a summer storm, and the discovery of an abandoned mine named Hollow Rock, he comes across a café hosting a beauty contest. He unpacks his dusty cello and climbs aboard the Open Top tourist bus, traveling through Belgrade. He is playing the Boccherini concert...

                (Personal story, told from passion, only with the help of friends. Filmed in 12 days, with a budget of 128 € and with a broken lens camera, and surveyor tripod.)</image:caption>

                Ciarán Fahey, a curious Irishman will tell the hidden history of these magical places, despised by some while causing a fascinating attraction to others. We reflect on the existence and nature of these spaces frozen in time and wonder about their uncertain future.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Another day, another victim for under-the-radar serial killer Dylan Weaver. He is driven by his desire to photograph the rawest human emotion: desperate fear. Each woman he photographs begging for life and then brutally kills, is collateral damage for his art and ascension to serial killer stardom. His popularity in the local news media grows with his body count, so the pressure is on to keep the police and the public interested. On the heels of his latest kill, Dylan has a new unsuspecting victim right where he wants her: his passenger's seat.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>MY LIFE WORKED OUT, is a two-hander, comedy web series surrounding the lives of JESS and AMY, two women in their late 20s who are best friends despite their polar opposite personalities. We follow their attempt to get their lives together as they sign up for the latest phase and craze to hit the LA gym scene...CLASS PASS. These are short (3-5 mins), comedy sketches in the vein of INSIDE AMY SCHUMER meets BROAD CITY. Each episode is set around a different over the top and ridiculous exercise class attended by Jess and Amy who embark on the endless pursuit of getting their lives to "work out" but just falling short...</image:caption>

            <image:title>How To Fall in Love</image:title>
            <image:caption>How To Fall in Love was created for the #JamesBayFilmProject. Filmmakers from around the world were invited to submit a 1-2 minute trailer for the opportunity to have their trailer commissioned into a 10-15 minute narrative short film. James was looking for creative filmmakers to develop narrative short films that were inspired by the themes, characters and emotions of his album Chaos And The Calm. This short film was inspired by the song "If You Ever Want to Be In Love" off the album.
                Well... we didn't win but we wanted to release the film anyways so we had a new soundtrack down and we will be submitting to various festivals that would be a good fit for this film.

                I liked the idea of a past, of someone who missed their chance but is willing to risk everything to bring them back. Someone who is willing to find the person they used to be and show them that they can be loved again.</image:caption>

            <image:title>WHITE STEPS</image:title>
            <image:caption>WHITE STEPS was filmed in Rwanda and Burundi during August 2014. The movie was not made to show the poverty and the hardships encountered in African countries, something which is already known, neither was it made to convince its audience to help the people of Africa. On the contrary, we want to emphasize the extent to which the people of those countries have been influenced by the Western world, according to the testimonies of natives as well as the volunteers who were there to help. These are not just testimonies, but rather intimate confessions from the hearts of all these people who experience the harsh reality of their daily lives. They fearlessly open their hearts in front of the camera, enlightening the minds of all those who ignore the truth.
                And the truth is that we shouldn't be heroes in the eyes of little children because we offer them candies, or in the eyes of the older ones because we offer them a loaf of bread… Let’s offer them knowledge and education, so that they can solve their problems by themselves with no need of the “WHITE STEPS”…
                The movie is a retrospection of the genocide of 1994 through individual testimonies and points of view. It points out the everyday problems of this world with finding water, food, surviving and analyzes the importance of education through interviews…
                “People say that education is the greatest good
                But some of our brothers even lack this”</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Story:
                In the year of 2058, Beijing becomes uninhabitable due to air pollution and sandstorms. People are forced to live underground. However they still wish they could go back to their homes above ground in the future, including the protagonist – a teenage schoolgirl.
                Although accompanied by a robotic teddy bear, she still feels lonely and misses her sister, a reporter working above ground broadcasting the progress of Beijing's environment restoration . However, she can’t find a way to reach the ground. One day, an intelligent sports car sees them and agrees to help them to go to the ground. The teddy bear does not trust the car and tries to stop the girl, but she insists. Finally, they both get in the car and start their journey.
                Their journey is tough. The gates to the ground are heavily guarded by soldiers. The car bravely jumps through the gates by driving across a ramp. Automated police cars, soldiers and tanks begin to chase them and drive them into a corner. In the end, both the car and the teddy bear sacrifice themselves to let the girl get into the elevator to the ground.
                After losing her friends, the girl, sad and scared, finally reaches the ground. However, after stepping out of the elevator, she only finds herself standing in the ruin of Beijing city amidst the heavy smog and huge sandstorms She also finds her sister, lying dead in front of an old green screen and scattered video cameras. Everything she believes proves to be a lie.
                “Dear sister, you are not alone,” says the girl, holding the skeleton hand of her dead sister. A ferocious sandstorm is approaching and they disappear in utter darkness.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Logline: A teenager walks on the street and gets influenced by the commands of his virtue. The film portrays a conflict between a person and his own soul, a person's wish to be unveiled but the virtue that coerces to wear a mask.
                Synopsis: The teen's virtue instigates him to opens up his shirt, with a naked body he is walking wearing a tie that symbolises his royalty. He asks a passerby for the time and gets ignored without help. He is on the haunts of dilemma. The compartments of his psyche protests and commands him to accomplish unnatural activities. He then asks if there's a cigarette shop nearby and still gets ignored. Having no money to pay to the shopkeeper after burning a cigarette he opens up his pant and gives it to the shopkeeper to pay his debt. Being naked he understands the futility of human existence to wear a tie and belong to this civilised society. The person metaphorically gets assassinated by his own cravings, yearns and addiction.</image:caption>

            <image:title>THREE THE MOVIE trailer</image:title>
            <image:caption>The number three is everything in this movie. Three and its multiples. Archaic, spiritual, transcendent numbers. Three, Six, Nine. Carriers of wisdom that lead us to the heart of theological monotheisms. Three, the Christian Trinity. Six, the points of the Star of David, The Jewish Star. Nine, the face of God in Sufi tradition, according to Islamic culture.
                Three stories are intertwined in a land, Friuli, which extends along a triple border. The stories of Irene, a Carnian, Christian girl; Pavel, Ukrainian and Jewish; Mehdi, Iranian and Muslim.
                Udine. A beautiful city, but one that is perceived as cold and inhospitable by emigrants. Pavel and Mehdi are illegal immigrants, who share an apartment - and concerns about social matters - in the “ghetto” of Via Roma. In love with Pavel, Irene tries to help them, but her surge of solidarity goes perhaps too far, and she regrets it... Mehdi lives obsessed with an ancient guilt: his fragile soul is attracted to Evil...
                “Above” them, the incarnation of metaphysical realities that rule the existence of men, three antagonists who raise the total number of characters to six. There is an old blind man, able to see beyond the phenomenal reality: an incarnation of Purgatory, the suffering of men waiting for a change of status. Monsignor Angelo is Paradise, the spiritual father of Irene, which advises, rebukes, protects ... A mysterious, provocative, sensual, poisonous woman is Evil, Hell incarnate.
                A triad of other figures raises the number of characters to nine: the novice Edo, who takes responsability for dealing with Pavel’s situation; Omar, a false friend who tries to corrupt the integrity of Mehdi; the Angel of the North, a figure originated in the Koranic tradition: it can be seen, sometimes behind the characters. Then, ten, a little girl...
                Predestination and moral choice. Two alternatives? Subjection to freedom of Good or Evil. What will the protagonists choose? This low-budget independent film, starting with the reconstruction of the micro (?) Universe of illegal immigrants in the Northeast of Italy, it opens up philosophical, visionary, surreal dimensions. To speak of equality in diversity. To search for the Same in the Other. This is poetic disenchantment.</image:caption>

            <image:title>The Eyes Wide Shut Masks</image:title>
            <image:caption>Rialto, Venice. In a short but remarkable workshop, in 1985 Franco Cecamore has created two original masks for the Venice Carnival. Twelve years later, a man with white coloured men's clothing, came to that shop: the man was Jan Harlan, executive producer of one of the last movies directed by Stanley Kubrick. He visited "Il Canovaccio" in order to buy several masks. One of them would be used by Kubrick in his last masterpiece "Eyes Wide Shut" for the character of Dr. Bill Harford, played by Tom Cruise. This documentary is the incredible and unknown story behind the creation of the most important masks of "Eyes Wide Shut." The artisans of this typical Italian product say that the origin of the art makes it a unique product. Original documents, photographs and the description of the meeting with the Kubrick's production make this the story we tell in our film.


                Rialto, Venezia. In una piccola ma bellissima bottega, nel 1985 Franco Ceccamore creò due maschere originali per il Carnevale di Venezia. Dodici anni dopo, un signore con un vestito bianco, entrò nel suo negozio: era Jan Harlan, produttore esecutivo degli ultimi film diretti da Stanley Kubrick. Visitò "Il Canovaccio", per acquistare alcune maschere. Una di queste sarebbe poi stata utilizzata da Kubrick, nel suo ultimo capolavoro Eyes Wide Shut, per il personaggio del dottor Bill Harford, interpretato da Tom Cruise. Questo documentario è l'incredibile e sconosciuta storia dietro la creazione delle più importanti maschere di Eyes Wide Shut. Gli artigiani di questo tipico prodotto italiano raccontano, nel documentario, l'origine di quell'arte manifatturiera che ha reso le maschere di Venezia come un prodotto unico, inimitabile e famoso in tutto il mondo. Documenti originali, fotografie e la descrizione dell'incontro con la produzione di Kubrick ... questa è la storia che raccontiamo nel nostro film.

                The 3 soldiers encounter internal conflicts within themselves that force them to the brink of mutiny, and murder.

Both conflicts eventually culminate when they reach there intended target and all hell breaks loose.....</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Wrestling; a sport, entertainment, and for some, a way of life.

                We all know at some level what it's like to fight for something, to unflinchingly wrestle with all our hearts. Maybe internally, maybe outwardly, regardless we know what it's like to fight, to wrestle, to choose day after day to say yes to that which would be easier to say no. The people of the Yida Refugee Camp in South Sudan have a uniquely vicious fight. A fight they wrestle and defeat daily with courageous love and optimism, a fight to survive and choose love over hate.

            <image:title>Spartiti - Austerità</image:title>
            <image:caption>SPARTITI: "Austerità" is the first single and video from their debut album and the song that gives the title to the entire album.
                -------------------------------------------------- -----------

                Austerità is the first single and video from the debut album of SPARTITI, the duo formed by Jukka Reverberi of Giardini di Mirò and Max Collini of Offlaga Disco Pax. The video was made by director Filippo Biagianti and emphasizes with a sumptuous black and white the haunting evocative capacity of the song. The lyrics outline the views of a child colliding with the pre consumistic era. The problems and difficulties of the adults are not, today as in 1973, very far. Two kids, a park, a shabby toy. Down the street, waiting for them, the sound of a guitar that comes directly into the heart, telling us what could have been and what would never be.

                AUSTERITÀ synopsis:

                A boy and a girl chase relentlessly while a small, old toy car is at the center of contention. The race continues on the street, in the park, on a carousel. Imagination runs wild, be a gunslinger for a moment, just before returning home. The toy car left behind, forgotten on the wall, along with the memory of another carefree afternoon spent to wander around. The problems and difficulties of the grownups are – hypothetically – elsewhere.

                This project was an experiment written and filmed on holiday in Lanzarote on a partially broken iPhone 5C with £2 worth of tripod and selfie stick. We drafted in holidaymakers, wrote script on the fly and filmed it all in a day. The main body of the film was filmed by ourselves and contains ourselves in the shots.

            <image:caption>A lighthearted short movie about an ordinary man who likes to run, his routine and how running touches various aspects of his life. The movie is reminiscent of an Indian family living abroad. It has a tinge of humor and fun moments as observed in daily life. It conveys a simple message "Running is not just about running, it's about living."</image:caption>

                MORI TUT GAYI AB AAS (DESOLATE REMEMBRANCE)

            <image:title>SUBCONSCIOUS - Director’s Cut 2013</image:title>
            <image:caption>Written and directed by Chris Petropoulos, SUBCONSCIOUS is the one and only Greek found footage film (with a high concept, realistic feel and plot twist), which premiered in 2010 in Sheffield UK and was a highlight selection at Thessaloniki International Film Festival in 2010.

                Fanis is a twenty-something boy who suffers from a particularly distressing nightmare that always seems to involve an intensely creepy shrine of unknown origin. He firmly believes that unraveling the mystery behind the dream will effectively dismantle these horrifying visions, and promptly sets out on a quest to secure what’s left of his sanity. This spooky adventure includes a strange girl Fanis meets on the internet, a long car ride across the Greek countryside, and a secluded house in the middle of nowhere. Needless to say, something extremely dreadful befalls poor Fanis and his skinny blonde companion during this questionable excursion into the foreboding countryside.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Bouddi</image:title>
            <image:caption>Bouddi, is a Bengali word by which sister-in-laws are lovingly referred to. The era of rich culture, which was evident in daily lives of many of Calcutta households, was a background for many a few romantics.

                Set in 1960 near Calcutta, Bouddi is a poignant tale of Paromita and Sukanto, who's love and innocent banter are stricken by much seriousness. Something in-between is not letting them talk. A tired and gruff Sukanto returns home waiting to unwind and de-stress from a long day, only to be pestered by his loving anxious wife who has been awaiting his return. But in vain does her love and melodious voice coax him and his hurtful demeanor. Something is Not allowing one's love to soothe the others pain. Paromita’s playfulness sings only to fail in coloring Sukanto’s much morbid temper.

                The indifference is hurting and the moments are unbearable, until the untimely visit of Joydeep, to whom Sukanto is a mentor at work and whom he revers as an elder brother. And unknowingly he brings eternity down to their doorstep and the lovers unite once again.</image:caption>

This traditional signboards are losing their popularity amongst younger business owners. Contemporary choice of business name replaces real business owner's name in our modern society. Signboard crafters in Singapore are assumed to have retired from their trade as producing such intricate signboards is time consuming and tedious. Project 'Signing Out' wants to archive and document local business owners, established in the 1960s (or businesses which were handed down during that period) that still proudly display their signboard as well as any other information such as belief, purpose promise and value etched into the board; how their business last till now. With such advance technology in our current state, it is heart-warming to be able to observe that there are still some groups who still keep old traditions alive. We mainly will target Chinese business owners such as traditional medicine hall, grocery store, coffee shop, clan association and others like bicycle shop or shop selling rattan products.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>All this unlucky guy wanted was to make a no-budget film. But everything went wrong. Actors quit and now there isn’t even a camera. He finds an envelope in his postbox which contains a letter and a black pill. The anonymous sender writes that the addressee left the black pill at his place and then wishes him goodbye forever. Our unlucky guy needs some drinks. As he is leaving for the liquor store he contemplates the black pill sitting on the table. In a split second he swallows it down. He finally leaves the house, but what is now happening? Could it be that this will be his last night on earth? What about these fragments and visions that seem to be connected in some way to his failed film project?</image:caption>

            <image:caption>I own the video. If shared, please credit my name or website http://www.bemmygail.com

                This is my very first 3d animated short film created as a student in IAFT (International Academy of Film and Television).

                The story is about a hungry little pink dragon named Pickle who's lost in the forest. Find out how she could get home and eat!

                I want this story to be as simple as possible, because I want people to simply see the beauty of life in a thousand little things. I know it still needs a lot of improvements, but it's a start! I hope this simple story could bring lasting joy to everyone. :3

                So, what happens when your hands grow tired of your commands and plot for freedom?

                Translated from Clive Barker's short story.

                THE BODY POLITIC:
                Charlie has been feeling odd lately. His hands haven't been feeling right, but on the contrary - they feel like they could take over the world. Plotting night after night, they have devised a plan to free themselves from that accursed body and live life on their own terms. The only issue is Charlie's awareness of the situation - he knows something isn't quite right with his hands. Hopefully, he finds out before the revolution begins...</image:caption>

Each article of clothing dictates the next move into the unknown space; sound amplifies the impact of the colliding costumes and contrasts to the space surrounding it. In the end, the thread of the film, the human body is left on its own and continues as a remnant of all that has accumulated.

                Inspired by the voyeuristic and fantastical feeling of Prada and Nike commercials, shots and images are imbued with a feeling of desire, allure and the impulse for more. The body is on view yet it is also the tool for manipulating the clothing and environment - the subjective/objective, personal/public is continually emphasized and revealed.

                Special thanks to Lululemon Lab for costuming, Sound designer Stefan Seslija, Makeup Artist Jess Hawkins, Director Nancy Lee, Director of Photography Sepehr Samimi and the commissioning support of FORM Festivals for making this film possible.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Samosir Island (Sumatra, Indinesia) is located in the middle of Toba lake, the largest volcanic lake in the world.
                The biggest known super volcanic eruption on Earth in the last 25 million years caused a global volcanic winter, killed most humans living at that time (69,000-77,000 years ago), and possibly affected the genetic make up of the human world-wide population.
                Samosir island is a home for Toba Batak people and the place where all the Batak come from originally. Unusual traditions and contemporary beliefs still coexist here.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Immutability according to vision is mainly hypothetical, not real.Everything in this mundane world is relative, brings the view that our judgements and ideals are conditioned by social, historical and personal factors, that relativity also determined through loci. Different loci bring different realizations. Eternal claustrophobic can not reify sunshine living in a compartment, not undervaluing yet missing the perception of another living in an Eden like atmosphere. Abnormal thing in one certain locus, is normal in different locus. Normality and abnormality are beyond question.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Elena</image:title>
            <image:caption>I created a short documentary about a Minneapolis musician and aerialist called, Elena. Elena has been a musician since she was child and became an aerialist at a very young age as well.

                For months I photographed Elena during her performances and from that I created a short documentary explaining her artistic practices.

                In March 2015 Elena and I created a collaboration project called, Sappho. "Sappho," is one of the earliest known Greek poets born on the island of Lesbos. Sappho was admired during the antiquity era, but the bulk of her poetry has been lost, however her reputation has survived through fragments of her work that was left behind. With Sappho in mind, we created an all female art collaboration including live music, documentaries, live painting, and print art.

                For four Sundays in March 2015 we held a live art event where we showcased women in art in Minnesota. During each event we would screen five of my own short documentaries. The final documentary screened was Elena and after an open discussion about the films, Elena and her band would perform. During the entire event, an invited artist would be painting as well as selling her latest pieces of work.

                This event brought different communities in Minneapolis together and created new networks for Minnesota's women in art. It was an opportunity for expression and creativity in a non judging environment. I plan to host more events like this in the future.</image:caption>

            <image:title>I AM DYSLEXIC - Short Student Animated Film - TRAILER</image:title>
            <image:caption>I AM DYSLEXIC - Short Student Animated Film - TRAILER

                A young dyslexic child falls into a world made entirely out of books. Alone in the environment his is forced to climb a mountain representing the education system.

                The animated short film I AM DYSLEXIC expresses what it feels like to have a learning difference in our current school system. Those with learning differences should be proud of who they are and should never be made to feel alone. The film uses strong metaphors to portray these emotions, as we follow a little boy in his journey to climb a mountain in a world made of books.

                I AM DYSLEXIC is an student animated short directed, produced and written by Mads Johan Øgaard and Katie Wyman. We are both Dyslexic and have both experienced different ways in which the school system tries to deal with dyslexic students, the good and the bad. We have made this film in the hopes of giving individuals who experience a learning differences something to relate to. Something to say; "Yes, this is a tough journey, but you're not alone and you can overcome the struggle!". This is content that many of us did not have growing up. Hence why we want as many people to see this film as possible, in the hopes it will give someone the courage to keep going.

                This is our first short film, it was made with no budget. We managed a team of over 60 other students, most of which also have from dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia, asperger's syndrome or similar learning differences. We want people to be proud and know they are not alone. We believe our current school system doesn't know how to deal with these learning differences, and that many students don't get the proper support they should have. We have experienced being looked down on for our different way of learning. We believe it is very important to show the world what this is and that it is possible to create beautiful things when you have a learning difference.</image:caption>

In “Cigno” the camera becomes the discrete observer of a common workday of common people, not to report or denounce, but to observe with curiosity a hidden routine, far from the modern society speed of life. And in the rusted deck, in the beat of the hammer, in the surfacing net we glimpse the dignity and the beauty of the Swan.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Rhizophora (Trailer)</image:title>
            <image:caption>It has been forty years since the Vietnam War. Yet, its toxic remnants are not fading. Dancing between waking and dreaming, "Rhizophora" follows eleven Vietnamese youth, with disabilities caused by Agent Orange, on a whimsical and intimate journey through their day. As the film progresses we are welcomed ever deeper into their richly symbiotic world.

                “Rhizophora” was conceived of and realized in a collaborative process between the featured group of residents and the Berlin based performing arts duo ¿Che.Ne.So?. It is both a meditation on the lasting impact of war as well as an ode to the power of life, which can flourish in even the most toxic of circumstances.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Having woken up in a small bungalow on an ocean coast, our hero doesn't remember from where is he and how he appeared here. Day by day he is covered by the increasing hopelessness and melancholy. The people meeting to him on the way don't understand what he is telling and can't give answers to his questions. The psychologist, neighbors, the new friend can't help him as the answer lies not outside, and inside.
                At the moment of blank despair, the hero rushes to the sea and, cast ashore, has a fatal dream. Finished excessively, he decides to walk without purpose. Infinite wandering brings him into the desert where on a hair from death, under the scorching sun, happens a wonderful meeting. The mysterious stranger perfectly understands his speech and promises to bring him to his "house”. But where actually will bring them these wanderings? Perhaps on a meeting with himself?</image:caption>

            <image:caption>The short movie „3.“ was created as a result of a couple of years of research. Throughout this period we conducted interviews with both men and women concerning the topic of relationships. Women's thoughts and experiences on love, loss and betrayal have by far made the biggest impact, provoking us to dwell on these matters, being that such questions seem to be timeless and still without response, even in the 21st century. What is a woman's true role in society nowadays? Is the label of the „ideal silent and obedient wife who's place is in the kitchen“ still impeding with her freedom, disguised as modern day fantasies of sex toys and mischievous corporate bunnies? In the 14 minutes of this movie we have tried to dive into these questions by telling a story of one young woman.</image:caption>

                Synopsis: “Stop violence &amp; save the childhood”
                Word from the Director:
                As usually I would like to talk about some real problems and stories coming from all around the world through my film creations. But I never focusing one certain family, people or any kind of group in here.
                And this is also a very common story happening all around the world, which is the parents get in to fight in front of their kids and getting separate or divorce.
                I just want to spread the word that saying those things are happening in the world, lets try to think and stop it. Specially because kids are the future of our world.
                So from this creation I tried to talk about a fiction story which is mom &amp; dad fighting in the house and kids living so frighten, so how the kids react inside these kind of situation by showing their strange behaviour.
                From "Gloomy Boy" I bringing this fiction story created by me from the kid's point of view to the audience, so i think this what make it special.

            <image:title>Whisper Down the Lane</image:title>
            <image:caption>"Whisper Down the Lane" is an experimental music video collaboration among four Denver artists. Each of three musicians recorded two musical ideas and passed one to each other musician. Having received two primary tracks, each musician recorded secondary tracks onto the primary tracks. Secondary tracks were passed again, and tertiary tracks were recorded. All recorded layers were then passed to a videographer for visual content, recorded in Colorado.

                One video was released each week, between March 26 and April 30, 2015.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Adverse Universe raises questions about human existence. The video shows the eternal battle between good and evil through metaphor. It implies that evil was always present in a place called "Apocalypse 11: 8" waiting to be summoned by an innocent soul, thus overcoming the good which is represented by "The Lady in White". Adverse Universe addresses life and death from an artist’s perspective, a world in which evil is always growing and celebrated by the masses.</image:caption>

                Hamlet says whilst humans appear to think and act as superior beings, they are essentially "dust". Hamlet is expressing his melancholy to his old friends over the difference between what humans aspire to and how they act, which is a great divide that deeply depresses him.</image:caption>

            <image:title>The Story of Gin</image:title>
            <image:caption>This animation is about the popular spirit Gin and its interesting and varied history. The style harks back to the early days of jazz music and cocktails, in its punchy music and strong, moody palette.  The story covers Gin's popularity throughout the decades and particularly its inclusion in cocktails and the cocktail era of the early 1950s.  Simple, graphic shapes and great palettes of rich colours were used to lend the retrospective feel that sums up Gin's character.  Although it is an entirely digital animation, the line quality and paper texture convey a traditional hand drawn touch.</image:caption>

                Description- Boy meets girl. Girl meets boy. They fall in love. Live happily ever after. Happy ending. Right?
                Wrong!
                Some love stories do not comprise of the usual ingredients of 'Lovestorying'. But that does not mean it's not love.
                Narrated through visual poetry and soul stirring music, Lovestorying is a short film about one such love story. Where our lovers are conflicted by their ideologies about love and what they feel for each other.

                like and comment!
                Share and give me your love and... feedback ;)
                cheers!</image:caption>

                I  always wonder what if we could freeze our memories for the day we miss that specific day, then thaw them out and live them for one more day as they are happening right now. It is a regular day to day life that is passing with daydreaming, the story of my grandfather's life in which we will live through one of his frozen memories.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Rick Cameron has always taken the road less travelled. Whether it was playing semi-pro hockey, or his stint as the costumed mascot of a major North American transit authority, no one will ever say that Rick has led a dull life. He's entertained thousands as a musician, as a stand-up comedian, and through a professional clown business that he ran for many years.
                Rick and his wife, who is 21-years his junior, left the city many years ago for a quieter life in the country, but that entrepreneurial spirt remained. They both drove school bus, and now run an arts and crafts store, along with a wine business. No matter the challenges, including a heart attack, and the tragic suicide of a step-son, Rick's zest for life lives on. The musician, now 81, he has released several CDs and continues to perform stand-up comedy and play in a band. 'Rick of All Trades' details the life story of a truly extraordinary man.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Canada's war dead make a final journey down the Highway of Heroes, a stretch of Highway 401 that leads from a southern Ontario airbase to the Coroner's Office in downtown Toronto.  In a gesture of support and national pride, thousands of flag-waving Canadians flocked to highway overpasses to help bear some of the weight of each family's loss.

                'Highway of Heroes - The Journey Home' presents a view of the highway rarely seen; that of devastated family members, racked with grief, but overwhelmed by the unwavering support of fellow Canadians on the overpasses above.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Bound by a promise he refuses to break, a timid man is unable to escape his toxic relationship and begins to lose himself along with his family.

                This is a true story based on the psychological abuse men face in relationships, ones that most men are afraid to share with anyone.

                The message is also to be very clear that most people are not care takers, and taking care of someone who has an illness, is a very tough challenge.</image:caption>

            <image:title>fences (no walls)</image:title>
            <image:caption>I was fooling around with iPhone’s panoramic feature when I noticed the way it broke up the patterns in a chain link fence. At the time, fences were going up in Europe in an effort to control the heavy human migrations coming from the Middle East and Africa. The use of the fence as a motif had already played a part in the art that I have created, and so I thought that maybe I should expand upon the discovery of this glitch. After stitching together a number of fence panoramas that were found in my neighborhood, I used the resulting pan as a type of score from which the electronic soundtrack was composed.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>These are four loosely connected episodes about loneliness and the plight of ageing in London. A widower observing life from his balcony; an Italian widow feeding the birds in a park; an eccentric loner with a passion for collecting coins, and a caring husband attending his bedridden wife. These snippets of apparently non-meaningful lives are constructed with the intend to highlight that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as our own.</image:caption>

In this murderous music over 20 years, films, poems, songs, dance, drawing, and other forms of art are constantly denouncing the wealth of this region as the basic of all these wars repeating in this Congolese region and these wars are supported financially and materially by western countries but a part from that, the African culture came out victorious in resistant to these wars.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>What’s Poetry? Is it perhaps the recollection of past things which are still alive in other allegorical places? Does Poetry hide herself behind an obscure message? Mostly, Life creates Poetry; Life intended as the epiphany that bring us along the line of a border as uncertain as the edge of the Sea. Poetry is a solitaire and reluctant figure, but when the spark of an idea lights up our feelings, she is ready to follow us. Without a research we can only wait, ready to understand that Life is everything and Poetry is in everything.</image:caption>

                We want to create a film that causes a visceral reaction in the spectator while at the same time being entertaining. We feel that’s the best type of experience, one that changes you, that penetrates your subjectivity.

                Our film can be described as a thriller with some neo-noir elements and an arthouse aesthetic. Drive, Only God Forgives and Under the Skin count as some of our inspirations. We want the film to be minimalist in it´s approach and we intend on letting the images speak for themselves.

                Insonia features Nuno Pardal, Mafalda Lencastre and Diogo Lima.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Northern Samar is one of the poorest provinces in the Philippines. Politicians here are elected into office by means of vote-buying. Most of them are based in Manila and they only come here during election time. They treat the province like it’s their hacienda.

                Some residents work as bodyguards and gunmen for politicians. For a small amount, they can be hired to gun down political rivals.

                Michael and Jess both hail from this province. Two different people whose lives are changed forever by seemingly identical events in their past.

                How should a man come to terms with the tragedies in his life? What does one do when faced with the adversary that hinders him from moving forward? Michael and Jess answer these questions and their stories are juxtaposed in this tale about vengeance and loss of innocence.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Published on Sep 1, 2016
                Singalila La In the Himalaya : The film is a Journey through the Sikkim and Nepal Himalayas: 14 day trek along the Singali la ridge, overlooking the views of Mount Kangchenjunga and Mount Everest.

                With ten porters, two guides and a cook, the team of three: George, Alexa and Blanchet starts their epic trek from Yuksam in West Sikkim.

                The team head north to Goecha La Pass to see early morning views of Mount Khangchenjunga and, then head west to the border of Nepal or the Singalila Ridge.

                From there they head south along the Singali La ridge to see Mount Everest and Mount Khangchenjunga.

                On the 13th day, the team reach a remote village at the border of India and Nepal, inhibited by a nomadic yak herder. The film was shot using camera powered by custom made solar chargers, as there was no power facility during the entire trek.

                George was affected by Keratoconus, a rare eye disorder which decreases the thickness of cornea and results in a distorted vision, during his childhood. During his teenage years, he lost all his hopes about life as this took him away from what he wanted to do in his life and what he dreamed. George finds that traveling is one of the best medicines for his eyes and end up trekking in the Himalayas to find solace and tranquility.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>The song "It's Been A While" talks about the myriad of misunderstandings that are caused by the lack of communication in modern relationships, whether of lovers, friends or family. Our lives are so fast faced that we fail to express our true emotions and hence may lose out on something that could've been. The song is about a girl who wonders whether her former friend/lover at all thinks about her, remembers her because he never kept in touch in spite of various promises. It's been a long time but she still wonders the meaning of that friendship.</image:caption>

            <image:title>DON'T LOOK AT THE MIRROR</image:title>
            <image:caption>''Don't look at the mirror'' is a short film that debuted in 2016, written and directed by Priscilla Grijalva and stars Lucero Fernández, Arnett Marcial, Clara Peralta and Ana Pratt. This short film is based on Japanes theology and static rituals.
                Julia (Lucero Fernández), Linda (Clara Peralta) and Cecilia (Ana Pratt) are three friends that reunite after a long period of time to catch up on old times. Cecilia talks about strange event that happened in her house, generating intrigue in Julia. At that moment Linda tells an old Japanese legend about a demon named Emma (Arnett Marcial) and the ritual to invoke it. Emma is the king of the hells in Japanese Buddhism, in charge of judging sinners souls and casting punishment accordingly, depending on how much evil they committed on earth. Even tough Cecilia did not feel afraid, the environment began to change, Linda took it as a joke but in Julia the situation was not the same, the fear and curiosity invade her body and when she goes to the rest-room to wash her hands, she makes the decision to do the ritual thinking that maybe it will just be silly.. or thats what she thought.</image:caption>

            <image:title>'CHILDREN OF THE STREETS' (DOCU-DRAMA)</image:title>
            <image:caption>The short film "Children of the streets" brings together a vivid description of what life on the streets is like for the dejected and desolate children who have been denied of love, care, and a decent childhood.

                The story tells the tale of two major characters "Halima" and "Aliyu", Halima who lost her mother at a young age of sixteen and recourses to giving her body to survive the coldness of the streets, and Aliyu on the other hand grew up with his own experiences as a child beggar. What becomes the fate of these two?

                Not leaving out orphaned Little Samuel who was chased out of the house he had assumed to be home, into the streets, at a very tender age. What becomes the fate of Samuel too?

                When children are mistreated, denied of love and care and exposed at a tender age to life threatening circumstances, they grow up with the life impoverished life pattern that has been imprinted on them. Who then is to blame?

            <image:title>NHS ARI Rooftop Garden - Short Film - 2016</image:title>
            <image:caption>A short film directed by Andrew Walker about the passion that went behind the making of a roof garden for hospital patients to relax and be outside whilst  they recover.
                Featuring photographs by Katherine Ferries and music from students from North East Scotland College, this short film covers the garden from its conception to its construction, and eventually its finish.

                "I think this garden is needed, not just at ARI. I think every hospital in the whole country should have gardens."

                Prof. Nigel Dunnett -  Garden Designer

            <image:title>the AMERICAN dream</image:title>
            <image:caption>For too long America has failed to acknowledge the outrageous and seemingly intractable rates of poor maternal health and deaths of mothers in childbirth. The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate of any industrialized country in the world. More than two women die every day in the US from pregnancy-related causes. And while the vast majority of countries have reduced their maternal mortality ratios, for the past 25 years the numbers of women lost during pregnancy, birth or postpartum have increased dramatically in the US.

                African-American women in the US are at especially high risk; they are nearly 4 times more likely to die of pregnancy-related complications compared to European American.
                Women of color are less likely to go into pregnancy in good health because of a lack of access to primary health care services. They are also less likely to have access to adequate maternal health care services. Black women are by far the largest demographic to suffer these outcomes, it has been this way for decades and yet they are seldom able to make their voices heard.

                Its time for change.
                Through the documentary “the AMERICAN dream” the women tell their own stories: they know what is wrong, they share their hopes, they share their fears, and they share about their American dream, related to maternal health in the US.
                Perhaps it is time to listen.</image:caption>

            <image:title>WHITE STEPS</image:title>
            <image:caption>WHITE STEPS was filmed in Rwanda and Burundi during August 2014. The movie was not made to show the poverty and the hardships encountered in African countries, something which is already known, neither was it made to convince its audience to help the people of Africa. On the contrary, we want to emphasize the extent to which the people of those countries have been influenced by the Western world, according to the testimonies of natives as well as the volunteers who were there to help. These are not just testimonies, but rather intimate confessions from the hearts of all these people who experience the harsh reality of their daily lives. They fearlessly open their hearts in front of the camera, enlightening the minds of all those who ignore the truth.
                And the truth is that we shouldn't be heroes in the eyes of little children because we offer them candies, or in the eyes of the older ones because we offer them a loaf of bread… Let’s offer them knowledge and education, so that they can solve their problems by themselves with no need of the “WHITE STEPS”…
                The movie is a retrospection of the genocide of 1994 through individual testimonies and points of view. It points out the everyday problems of this world with finding water, food, surviving and analyzes the importance of education through interviews…
                “People say that education is the greatest good
                But some of our brothers even lack this”</image:caption>

            <image:caption>This is a short animated film based on The Epic Of Gilgamesh, made as my graduation film at CSM.
                The original story is the oldest written story known to us, it dates back to third millennium BC, when Sumerians were developing the first civilisation in Mesopotamia. It tells the story of a half king, half god, who sets off on his journey in search of immortality.

                Two different technique are used through out, one is Plasticine, manipulated frame by frame under the camera. The other is using Glycerine and ink. It is all done by hand and there is no computer-generated imagery as the challenge was to explore how the possibilities and limitations that come with a traditional technique effects the process, the artist and the audience.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Living The Room // Dance for Film Preview</image:title>
            <image:caption>This film is a collection of personal and inherently human stories. It begins with an empty 103-year-old house. Six tidy rooms are distinctly empty except for their echoes of life. When the camera settles in the living room the first chapter unfolds; a sextet, a quartet, a trio, two duets, and two solos take place in the living room, bedroom, kitchen, dining room, bathroom, and foyer to bestir some stories of this house and its people.
                Humans as individuals often get stuck in routine without realization – just as each of the women in this film continue on with their cyclical processes. Sometimes outside forces and relationships can push / pull a person to new places and experiences, but the home, as a place of comfort, ownership, and things, often perpetuates routine. As such, during the film all sense of chronology takes a surreal effect: day and night are switched and order-less, dances will often happen in the background of other pieces, dancers to be in two places at once, and phrases and props are often recurring causing a disconnect to time. Perhaps all of the dances are occurring simultaneously. Perhaps the story is an endless loop.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Saudade Es Extranjero</image:title>
            <image:caption>In Spanish, the word Extranjero can be used interchangeably as ‘foreigner’
                or ‘abroad’. For Camilo Sanchez this poetically resembles his feelings of
                isolation, perplexity and anticipation during his travels as an educational
                migrant. In Portuguese, the word Saudade can be described as sentiment
                for a home dearly missed. Held together, these words reflect Camilo’s multivocal
                experience of having to adapt to two new languages as he studied, as
                they gradually merged together into one.

                Saudade Es Extranjero (Nostalgia is Abroad) is a reflexive exploration into
                the relationship between travel-based study and the impact of adapting to
                new languages along the way. A blend of interview, multilingual inter-titles
                and observational footage, this short documentary follows Camilo, a graduate
                from Valledupar, Columbia.

                Camilo’s educational journey began when he left Columbia for Britain to
                learn fluent English, before leaving once more to Rio de Janeiro University
                to begin his masters. Camilo left speaking Spanish and through his travel
                has learned English and Portuguese fluently in just over a year. In the film,
                Camilo shares the experience of new languages and their cultures.
                With the predominant theme of language, the short documentary is divided
                with a sequence of inter-title monologues, in a form inspired by 1960s
                Third Cinema films by Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino. Following
                the multivocality of Camilo both in person and in interview, the inter-title
                monologues jump between each language in hope the viewer can experience
                this as well.
                The documentary explores diasporic topics such as stereotypes, changing
                identities and living in a globalised world.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Set ten years in the future, Virgil, an English Language Steward (not teacher) works in a school which achieves 100 hundred per cent success rate. Dressed in a red hooded outfit which suggests his low rank, Virgil has been employed to assist the efficient auto-prof: a computerised English instructor. The machine unleashes utilitarian English classes pitched way below its students’ levels in order to guarantee passes and maintain the school’s reputation. Virgil becomes taken by a student, Marie, who somehow manages to stir him from the drudgery of his apathetic classroom role. He fails one of the student’s test in his class and is ordered by his superiors to amend the score if he wishes to keep his position, taking into account the dwindling jobs market. He is bullied, harassed and intimated into complying with a system that is decayed, corrupted and abusive towards its employees.</image:caption>

However, despite outward appearances, Blake's job is a nightmare, his marriage is rife with stress, and his life is far from what he had hoped it would be.

            <image:caption>After a 16 year hiatus, the portuguese band Galore is finally back on the scene. Their first-ever music video covers the single "Hanging Around" (from their Living Room Rehearsal Tapes EP) which takes us on a wild ride, and we can safely say that Galore aren't just "hanging around"... they're here to stay!</image:caption>

            <image:title>Mulheres em Série - Episódio 5 e Episódio 6</image:title>
            <image:caption>Mulheres em Série: nova série traz mulheres ‘fora dos padrões’ como protagonistas
                Negras, lésbicas, gordas e transgêneros são personagens ainda raras nas obras audiovisuais mais consumidas atualmente e sua representação é quase inexistente no principal produto do tipo no Brasil: as novelas. Quando aparecem, são tratadas de maneira caricata e jocosa, o que acaba reforçando estereótipos e preconceitos que a nossa sociedade insiste em cultivar.
                Na contramão dessa tradição, Mulheres em Série traz, já em seu primeiro episódio, a força das mulheres comuns, os dramas reais e os inúmeros preconceitos que essas protagonistas sentem na pele, como milhares de brasileiras todos os dias. Letícia, por exemplo, a mulher transgênero que sonha em ser mãe, interpretada por uma atriz negra e também transgênero, representa os desafios desse grupo ainda marginalizado em nossa sociedade: segundo pesquisa da Transgender Europe, o Brasil é o país que mais mata transexuais no mundo.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>pass: 123456

                Director's word:
                This short movie is an endeavor to help vulnerable children whose creativity has been adversely affected by their careless family. The indifference and lack of family protection destroy the children's creativity, leaving them unwilling to do their favorite activities.
                The film has also attempted to draw the society's attention to this harm, to encourage children to rehabilitate themselves and replace despair with hope, and to remind families of the responsibility for their children's future

                Synopsis:
                A little girl expressed her feelings through her painting to show her family. But unfortunately drawing this painting finally disappointed her.</image:caption>

            <image:title>The Autonomous Era</image:title>
            <image:caption>Hong Kong has turned over a new leaf since people were awakened by the Umbrella Movement in 2014. The director tries to re-narrate the stories happening in 2010 through a new perspective inspired by Umbrella Movement.

                In 2010, together with some friends, Lok actively participated in social movements using online radio broadcast as a medium to spread their ideas. 4 years have passed, Lok is now an organizer of various social movements. With a new identity and more experience, Lok recalls the old days when he participated in the Umbrella Movement.

                “The imaginary doesn’t reflect reality. It’s the reality of the reflection.” (Jean-Luc Godard, La Chinoise) Director worked for NGO. With his experience, The Autonomous Era is a cinematic “thesis” analyzing the organizational problem, which deeply affects Hong Kong social movements in these years, from a perspective of a social movement organizer.</image:caption>

                state, the two try and hang on while old but real feelings

            <image:caption>Thai  boxing is not just the Thai national sport, but it represents Thai cultural heritage. Most people have the perception that Thai boxing is violent, gambling, and painful especially for kid boxers. This leads to the question “Why do they decide to be a Thai boxer?”, “Why do their parents support them?”, “Are they poor?”, and “Do they have low education?” No one know the answer, except them. Boss is a 13 year old boy from poor’s family who travelled from north east of Thailand to the central city, Bangkok. He was invited from his uncle to start the life on the boxing ring. His flight name is Singsiam Sitcharnsing which means the lion of Siam country (the old of Thailand name) from Sitcharnsing gy. A lot of obstacles are waiting for him, but he never gives up and keeps moving forward. Even though his parents afraid on his painful, but they still support him. Why? Boss has a great dream!!!…</image:caption>

            <image:title>B-Tweets</image:title>
            <image:caption>B-Tweets is a short story of two book lovers who date on the pages of their favorite books and how fate directs their love.

                While the world is leaning more towards technology, this movie is an attempt to increase the book readers in the society. The story revolves around two book-lovers who date on the pages of their favorite books anonymously. The film not only attempts to bring back the reading habits of the yore to present, it also touches upon the necessities of technology to fetch us what we are looking for.

                Meet Gauri and Rounak, book lovers of different kind, as they chart out their story through their favorite books through the magic of words that touch the soul.

                Love comes in all forms. Shapes. Sizes. Faces. Sometimes, love comes gift wrapped in a new dress or an old song or a familiar fragrance. Sometimes, love finds its way through words. Inhale the scent of the yellowing pages, exhale the wisdom of their sayings and in-between, simply fall in love with love.
                Because, sometimes you can fall in love with souls instead of faces. Because, sometimes all love needs is words. Because sometimes, in love even 140 characters are enough!

                Why B-Tweets ?
                B-Tweets is a title that emerged from the essence of the story. We all know about e-mail that comes through electronic mail. B-Tweet is the shortened version of Book Tweet, that acts as a platform for the climax.

                What are the main features of the film?
                The idea is one of the main features of the film – exploring the potential of books. On a lighter note, love and books go hand in hand. In addition to this, the team is a belt of ambitious youngsters with an urge to create creative content.

                Why ‘Books’?
                Because, they hold the potential of being our best friends. Words are not just words, they are a medium to convey something. A book reading habit, if cultivated renders great results in overall development of human beings.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>It´s a music video, from the spanish band Mürfila.
                This video was shot in August 2015 in USA, a real road movie set in several American states: from Virginia Beach to the West Coast.
                It´s an iconic journey of 8000 kilometers that crosses the most emblematic places of this country: the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, the Park of the Sequoias, or cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas or Seattle ...
                NO PAIN is a tribute to everything that fascinates the American world: its deserts, its parks, neon cities, remote villages, endless highways, motels ...
                And could not miss the film references, as the film True Romance, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Drive, Natural Born Killers ...
                There are also musical references, as the bridge that Kurt Cobain used to kill his time as a teenager in Aberdeen, now full of painted people worldwide. Bridge talking Nirvana song "Something in the Way".
                NO PAIN is a journey, a roadtrip all the way, a cocktail of emotions, love and freedom.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Breath of Heaven Short (Music) Film</image:title>
            <image:caption>As I began the arrangement of "Breath of Heaven" I wanted to share a story from a moment of my life. While filming in Santorini, Greece I recreated a chapter in my journey where my mother was born and raised in Santorini, Greece. Each note of the music is a word of a vivid story being reborn and told again in a poetic and musical expression. A journey of shattered dreams, new dreams, rediscovering a new chapter in life with God's hopes and promises.

                Thank you to everyone who made this possible and has been part of this creative journey.

                May you be inspired!

            <image:title>A' mes amours</image:title>
            <image:caption>This film originated from my heart as a way to encounter myself.
                I needed a place where I could listen to myself.  No need to say this wasn’t the best project to be presented to any producer, so I made my choice: fixed DSLR camera and two
                Nikon lenses from the seventies.
                I always shoot in order to realize who am I: here hence the camera must be fixed as I need contemplation and separation. I spent many years identifying myself in everything and now I want to breathe more deeply.
                The paucity of the means in my availability has been transformed from limit to identity of this film: having just a few things to take care of, forced me to open my eyes wider and to look for the best view angle in relation to space, light and history. Paucity has also been an asset so far as this is film about our ability to look at things simply and about the importance of our point of view on life; our point of view can turn life good or bad, regardless of what’s actually going on. In the end, this film is a note of this stage of my journey. This film is a hug to my past, my present and to all the love around me.</image:caption>

The main idea of this collection is therefore connection of work clothes, the typical czech fabric kanafas (and its use in diferent contexts) and the preservation of the authenticity in connection to the Yamamoto's approach. In collection author uses leather and new technical material, too. Michaela would like to make present casual menswear from typical work clothes.

            <image:caption>Nourhane was a singer and actress in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s.
                She put a sudden end to her career and retreated away from the stage in the mid-60s.
                From that point on, she never spoke about her past, nor did she sing.
                Her grand-daughter goes into the world of filmmaking and at the age of 21 discovers her grandmother's past. From that point on, she is on a quest to find out as much as possible about her grandmother's career and life, and particularly about why her grandmother left a career at its height.
                Layers and layers of stories emerge through interviews, voice-overs, drawings, and animated sequences in a film centered around passion, and love.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Melpomene Music Video</image:title>
            <image:caption>Melpomene illustrates God's redemptive declaration. Forced to leave behind the dreams of her youth, Melpomene embarked into uncharted lands.

                Just when you realize that this journey is beyond your strength, you find yourself walking into the light of truth that lights a path onto the road to freedom allowing redemption to take place. The only road that leads HOME.

                Each of us has a story to write. Don't let the pages of your story collect dust. Be a brave voice, be obedient and faithful to your calling, even when it doesn't make sense. When you see your world falling apart, at the end of a prayer is a new beginning. The birth of a dream. The beginning of a miracle. The fulfillment of a promise. The beginning of things falling into place as you are being rescued from the shadows that have kept your God given dreams, destiny and purpose in bondage.

                Prayer gives us the power to carry on. It may not change circumstances, but it changes us and gives us the strength to move forward. I wonder if Isaiah was speaking about Tamar, Rahab, Ruth or Bathsheba when he was writing the book of Isaiah 54:4-8 ages ago.

                Nothing is ever wasted. God's grace can redeem and restore what was once lost.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Gomari, a village girl slips out of a sermon at the temple and into the thick jungle to frolic with her lover but they both fall prey to a leopard. People in the nearby village listen to the monk for advice, except the hunter who lives in the jungle. The hunter provides the village with meat even though he is a vegetarian. It is the month of Vesak and the people from the nearby village plan to observe the precepts on Vesak full moon day. The hunter knows what happened to Gomari and entreats the Monk to cancel his scheduled program but the monk refuses and leads such matters to fate. The hunter, who never kills except as food for people, is forced to contemplate acting pre-emptively and kill the leopard even though it goes against his principles.</image:caption>

            <image:title>FADING Official Trailer</image:title>
            <image:caption>On April 18, 1945, the photographer Robert Capa took several pictures of the American Division in a house in Leipzig during the liberation from the Nazis. The series was published in Life Magazine and became famously known as the "Last Man to Die".
                From Capa’s point of view and shot on the original site with origninal sounds, this film reconstructs the last minutes of U.S. soldier Raymond J. Bowman's life just before he was shot and subsequently photographed by Capa.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Empty Tables. A Tribute To Frank Sinatra</image:title>
            <image:caption>That was the last song Johnny Mercer wrote. He was a close friend of Sinatra and, of course, he wrote it for him. The lyrics are devastating: One man at the end of a career of success feels alone and he only miss a talk, a dinner with a woman. But he is talking to empty tables, there is nobody there to listen to him. The singer in the video, Jordi Rabascall, is a follower of Sinatra since his beginning as an electronic musician. I thought the best way to do a video of Empty Tables it was transforming Jordi in a ghost. But we need an old Mercer, an old Sinatra, an old Jordi. So we ask to the amazing jazz piano player Pere Ferré to join us in this adventure. So he is the Mercer-Sinatra looking for his own soul, a soul made when he was a young musician blind for Las Vegas lights...</image:caption>

            <image:title>SITA</image:title>
            <image:caption>According to Indian mythologies, women are considered to be the center of immense energy and power. At the same time women have been a target of social evils and objects of oppression. Sita is a provocative short film, revolving around the issue of rape in the modern world. The protagonist is about to be attacked by three men for rape and what she does, depicts a deep universal meaning and significance. Sita is inspired by Ramayana, where mother Sita is believed to be born out of the Earth and after a life of displeasure and suffering, she chose to merge with the Earth. The laxman rekha drawn by her brother -in- law was to protect her from any evil. Despite that she was taken away by Ravana, the villian in the story. Sita is a representative for all women out there who have the blessing of nature to procreate, the power to give birth to a new entity in the world. A mother's womb is a symbol of universal power that a woman possesses. The crime against women such as rape is a disrespect of this universal energy which human beings are bound to protect and preserve.</image:caption>

            <image:title>KALICHAAT OFFICIAL TRAILER</image:title>
            <image:caption>Kalichaat, the hard black rock, symbolically represents the sum total of infinite hurdles a farmer in India face in hopes of making his and his family's life better.  It also translates into a labyrinth of complex government procedures and a system promoting hopelessness among the provider of society – The Farmer.

                The story revolves around Sitaram, a farmer like many other in central India, with less than limited means.  Trying hard to meet ends and provide for his family the basics of life.  The problem, repeatedly failing monsoon, the lifeline of Indian farmers, making his land yield nothing but weed despite him doing all he can.  His family of 5, including his wife, two sons, and a daughter suffers along.

                Sitaram's efforts to quench the thirst of his land lead him try and dig a well in his land.  The hard sound of mattock hitting the dreadful black rock – Kalichaat – is nothing but a disaster, as cracking Kalichaat and reaching water beneath will require means beyond his approach.  But to match adversities with his will, he approaches the local bank specifically established to meet the needs of farmers, only to realize that getting help there is even complex than breaking Kalichaat.

                In this state of despair, the showering water coming out of a tubewell drilling at his village makes him wonder why can't he have one at his land.  A hope for him, perceived a gamble by many, including his wife.  Again the seemingly never ending tryst with authorities and loan sharks, religious gurus, while keeping his family hopeful for a better future, begins.

                Pledging the very land he wanted water for, tubewell drilling starts.  One after another, attempts fail, land shrinks and hopes die.  What's left is a question on our conscience as a society and as a system, as to why we let the actual breadwinner die in pursuit of a better life.</image:caption>

            <image:title>SITA OFFICIAL TRAILER</image:title>
            <image:caption>According to Indian mythologies, women are considered to be the center of immense energy and power. At the same time women have been a target of social evils and objects of oppression. Sita is a provocative short film, revolving around the issue of rape in the modern world. The protagonist is about to be attacked by three men for rape and what she does, depicts a deep universal meaning and significance. Sita is inspired by Ramayana, where mother Sita is believed to be born out of the Earth and after a life of displeasure and suffering, she chose to merge with the Earth. The laxman rekha drawn by her brother -in- law was to protect her from any evil. Despite that she was taken away by Ravana, the villian in the story. Sita is a representative for all women out there who have the blessing of nature to procreate, the power to give birth to a new entity in the world. A mother's womb is a symbol of universal power that a woman possesses. The crime against women such as rape is a disrespect of this universal energy which human beings are bound to protect and preserve.

            <image:caption>Feel free to watch and distribute it! http://cinema-documentar.ro/, http://novapolaris.ro/ .Cu sprijinul Asociatiei Culturale pentru Istorie Vie - Alba Iulia.
                Sinopsis: "In drumul sau spre Apulum, un soldat roman din legiunile cantonate in Dacia, isi disputa viata dupa mofturile schimbatoarei zeite a norocului, Fortuna."
                Dialogurile sunt in limba latina.

                http://livehistoryfans.com/roman-cons...
                “Capriciile Fortunei” este cel mai recent film realizat de Asociatia Nova Polaris, Sibiu. Un scurt-metraj istoric, de fictiune, cu actiunea plasata in antichitatea romana de pe cuprinsul fostei provincii Dacia.
                Am incercat prin acest film-pilot, la o scara mai mica, sa demonstram ca filmul istoric romanesc ne este posibil. Pe viitor, cu un suport financiar adecvat, cu sprijinul trupelor de reenactori din Romania si al autoritatilor administrative locale sau muzeale, speram sa putem realiza si un film de lungmetraj istoric, cu mijloace si inspiratie moderna, pe care publicul indragostit de faimoasele conflicte “daco-romane” sa il indrageasca.
                Depinde de noi, cei implicati in mediul cinematografic sau istoric si de deschiderea afisata de cei cu posibilitati, ca acest film sa existe in urmatorii ani si sa nu ramana doar un vis…

            <image:caption>Story of a new film maker’s struggle to bring forth his creations in front of the world. Taking a cue from the practical world of film making where producers look for formula based stories which guarantees them an assured return on investment.
                The story is about a director named Abhirup Mitra whose initiative to make movies on good stories does not find any producers. Frustrated by his efforts going wasted, Abhirup destroys most of his writings.
                Sometimes later a reporter named Satarupa discovers Abhirup’s stories in a cover diary which is found in a book store. This reporter brings forth the talent of Abhirup in front of the world.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>As we look back at the beginning of the tradition of celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi, we learn that the first idols for this day were made from the wet clay from the local rivers and lakes. The day after Chaturthi celebrations, these idols were immersed in the same lake. Now, times have changed and so have the styles of preparation. Local clubs and communities started hosting mass pujas to commemorate Ganesh festival. Today, since there is competitive nature amongst all these local clubs to make the best of the idols and win awards, the old concept of clay idols started vanishing. The artisans of the recent times who make Ganesh idols use Plaster of Paris and other toxic bright Colors, which are very harmful and make the waters toxic and in consumable for a long time.</image:caption>

            <image:title>The Eternal Flame of Truth</image:title>
            <image:caption>This film depicts the belief that if we choose to accept the truth within- the introspection, we do face the light of the truth and begin to understand and grow (develop ourselves). We also have a choice of not doing so, in that scenario we choose to go back into darkness and could possibly end up living a life of ignorance.
                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                All that matters in this life, on this planet that we share with other living beings- is the constant burning of the eternal flame of truth. And, where can one discover this ever-glowing flame of Truth?
                Within us, within all living beings!
                We are all connected by the precious thread of life. Life that manifests itself, in the compassion and kindness that we feel for one and all. To love oneself first and foremost, and then share it with the rest of the world. One of the ways to keep this flame of truth not lose it's glow is by respecting all living beings and to accept them for their individuality- for respect given is respect earned.
                Love, respect and accept one and all the way they are for everything that is in nature is natural. We are all love and respect worthy. If we want to discover and keep in touch with the inner flame of truth, keep it glowing forever then we would have to learn to love without prejudices, be more 'giving' and believe in the power of Love.

            <image:caption>A comparative portrayal of the hardships and realities of living with a mental illness on both sides of the pond. Real stories, of real people, who happen to suffer with a mental illness. This film explores the stigma, discrimination, prejudice and trivialisation faced by those who carry such a label. There is always hope that as more people share the brutal realities of coping with a mental illness, that those living in fear or without hope may find the help or treatment they so desperately need, and that finally, public opinion of mental health will sway from the stereotypical and the reductive, towards the empathetic and the supportive, it really is time this changed.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Victor and his team of secret agents have arrested an important mafia man in Barcelona and interrogates him with unorthodox methods.
                Through the use of a particular graphic technique (like a comic in motion), The Slave Of Silence reveals all the ambiguity of violence and the ethic of honor.
                The short film by noir mood, directed and painted by Francesco Fracchioni and scored by the winner of the "Los Angeles Music Award" Stefano Gargiulo, is inspired by the book I Servi Del Silenzio written by Marino Fracchioni and introduces us to the first events of the novel.
                To complete this short, Francesco Fracchioni needed almost a year of work.</image:caption>

Not many people know about this matter, but it does exist, and we all have to do our share in ending it.
                In my animation, you follow a young boy who grew up in a violent home and how this lead him to isolate himself from the world around him, not being able to trust anyone. In the end, he manages to break through the walls he built.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>A reporter with great ambitions is constantly assigned to cover small local stories that are nothing more than silly events disguised as news for ratings sake. His professional goal to cover big news like wars gets further away from him when his producer assigns him to report on a student feature film that cast a faded movie star from the eighties trying a comeback. This might be the last chance for the movie star to restart his career, because his wild life style during the eighties impacted his memory and casting possibilities.
                As the reporter watches the making off video and interviews everyone on the set, his frustration with the self-involved film students can't be surpassed by any new assignment until his producer calls again.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Love The Original Way</image:title>
            <image:caption>With all the love and lust in the air, we owe a majority of credibility to online dating apps. So many couples have formulated a relationship and now even marriages have concluded from online dating as well. With that being said, Keldamuzik produced her first short film called “Love The Original Way”, directed by Hassan Leo of Elmore films. The 15 minute short film displays a young college graduate by the name of Sissy who surrounds herself by her two gossiping girlfriends friends Milan and Laudi who encourage her to try a dating app. Both characters demonstrate how young women today face troubles of finding the love of their life. Sissy as a college graduate has had problems with drug and alcohol addiction and keeping a current job, therefore she turned to online dating and rehab at the same time to put her life into perspective. Once she found out that the same guy she has been conversing with on the dating app, sits adjacent from her in alcohol rehab, they fell in love instantly.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>A student finds himself trapped in the halls of his high school and terrorized by someone eerily familiar.

                Kenopsia was filmed by the Desert Christian High School Digital Media Production class as a final project for the 2015-2016 school year. The film was shot on a Canon T5i and an iPhone 6s Plus. While most of the film was shot with the Canon 18-135mm kit lens, the dreamy, soft-focus shots were captured with a Lensbaby Spark. Sound was captured with a Røde VideoMic Pro and a Zoom H4n. The film was edited on DaVinci Resolve 12 and Adobe Premier CC, with all of the color correction and effects editing done on DaVinci Resolve 12.

                This 3 minute cut was originally created for the My Røde Reel 2016 film competition.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Yala, the forbidden harangue</image:title>
            <image:caption>The 60s…
                The generational rebellion began to spread throughout the world.

                In Mendoza, the thinker Mario Rodriguez Cobos (known as SILO) is dedicated to form study groups.

                In 1965, a group of young people (none of them older than 30 years), led by Silo, travel to the province of Jujuy, northern Argentina, to make a withdrawal of self-knowledge in the Arenal. They are arrested by the military dictatorship.

                Then the group is installed on a wild and isolated area.
                A place known as Yala.
                They perform work with care centers, levels of consciousness, overcoming suffering, meaninglessness, and many others, in the context of the pursuit of awakening.

                On July 20, 1969, Silo tries to give a speech in Yala, to lift the continent out of its lethargy and lead the process of spiritual revolution was coming.
                The Catholic Church, the de facto government and the military forces prevented the act.
                Since then, the fact is known as "The Forbidden Arenga".

                Today, different groups of Siloists approach Yala to remember and commemorate that forbidden harangue.</image:caption>

            <image:title>PIERPAOLO-TRAILER</image:title>
            <image:caption>PierPaolo tells us about Pier Paolo Pasolini’s childhood and youth years, through the main characters of his life: his father Carlo Alberto, with whom he has a difficult love-hatred relationship; his mother, he’ll be very close with until his final days, they even lived together in the same house; his younger brother Guido, who joins the partisans during World War II and ends up murdered under strange circumstances; the delicate romantic and friendship relationship with two women: violinist Pina Kalz, a war refugee, and schoolteacher María, who went steady with him; and his deep infatuation with a peasant boy named Toni, he will keep this friendship throughout his life.

                PierPaolo also takes us through the places that so marked his life (Belluno, Casarsa della Delizia, Scandiano, Conegliano, Sacile, Parma, Idria, Bologna, Versutta…) as since birth, Pasolini, became nomadic due to the moving from city to city, because his father was an army officer and every few months was appointed to new barracks.
                During those days his fascination for trains started, in the long waiting hours at the station and his love for the region of Friuli, where his mother belonged, that brought the discovery of an archaic and peasant word that boosted his creativity.

                PierPaolo guides us inevitably to the scandal that will mark his whole life (Ramuscello) and his escape to Rome along with his mother in pursuit of better times…</image:caption>

                In the third music video off of award-winning composer David Rosen’s second album An Unseen Sky, “Shadows on the Ceiling” tells the story of a little girl whose imagination is set off by shadows in her room. She runs off into a dream world to escape the darkness until she can be sure she can return safely to her bed.

                The video comes from an idea by director A.R. Kagan who is also the mother of Alexa Jade Kagan, the star of the video. The music and story go together perfectly to create a beautiful picture of childhood imagination.

                Directed &amp; Shot by A.R. Kagan
                Edited by A.R. Kagan and David Rosen
                Music by David Rosen

                An Unseen Sky is available for pre-order now at http://davidrosen.bandcamp.com with a full release to follow on all digital music stores by April 7th, 2015!

            <image:caption>Brenda Bleasant is “back, baby!” and boldly taking the Yucaipa, California market by storm. And, by storm, we mean a slight drizzle. Brenda’s break from the business has left her aesthetic somewhere in the 90s. Unaware of the modern world or her dated style, she teases her giant bangs and prepares for her big, bedazzled comeback. But, once she returns, she finds the whole “wedding biz” has changed. Luckily, her niece, sweet and more style-savvy Penny, is in need of an internship to complete her event planning certificate — the perfect fit. Or, is it? When Penny steps into Brenda’s pink and purple satin-covered office, she begins to question her decision. As Penny bears witness to her aunt’s outlandish ways, Penny is determined to turn the beat around. But, can she do it?</image:caption>

                This project was made a number of years ago by a bunch of us Columbia College Hollywood grads.

                It was primarily shot on 35mm with the end green screen footage on DV.  The wind was so bad at the Lancaster shooting location that all of the dialogue and sounds had to be recreated in post.

                "The Gatekeeper" stars Mary L. Carter and Clint Glenn Hummel.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Eastern Indochina - Documenting a Journey</image:title>
            <image:caption>For centuries the south-western part of Asia was filled with an array of small kingdoms that remained under the reign of powerful China.
                Today's Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand share their cultural roots that have their basis in common history, religion and similar social conditions.
                Despite the existence of borders, the countries of Indochina are inhabited to a great extent by the same ethnic groups that have matured culturally in similar economic and political circumstances. The ancient and modern history have linked the inhabitants of the region into a cultural unity.
                We first came to South-East Asia in 2008. We travelled across Thailand, Burma and Cambodia and made a promise to ourselves to return to Indochina again.
                For this reason we made a journey to Vietnam and Laos in 2014 and visited also the northern part of Thailand. This film was made during that particular journey - a travelogue describing our voyage across Eastern Indochina.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Russia, Moscow, our days. Two young men, adhering to no unambiguously expressed civic stand, consider themselves fascists. Influenced by the environment and fascinated by the pseudo-appeal of external attributes, they remain unaware of how far all of it may lead to. A leader of the organization commits murder which the main characters are later on accused of. The situation is complicated by the fact that the protagonist falls in love with a girl belonging to the movement ANTIFA. In attempt to prove their innocence both guys face manifestations of the real fascism, and the latter turns out to completely contradict their real beliefs and internal principles. The movie shows that fascism is alien to any normal person and healthy society, regardless of the country, nationality and social status in question.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Dreamcaught</image:title>
            <image:caption>"Dreamcaught" is a 3 min short animation by Polish animation student Natasza Cetner. It focuses on relations between seemingly accidental images we come across in our dreams or nightmares.

                The visions we see in our dreams can tell us some stories with sensible plots and characters. We can replay our memories changed in a way according to our emotions or experiences. But what is the most disturbing and therefore fascinating is the chain of surprising, grotesque dark scenes that are stuck in our subconscious. For some reason they are "shown" together as one. But why? Is that because they are all some kind of interpretations of what we feel right now? What is driving us crazy or is it
                the projection of our most hidden fears?

                The film is about those blurred connections between the pictures projected in our sleeping minds. The shots seem to be random, they change rapidly, and the plot is twisted so there is different concept of the meaning for everyone of us.

                The film is kept in dark surrealistic atmosphere mostly inspired by 20th Century photography such as Andre Kertesz and Henri Cartier-Bresson with a strong influence of works written by Guillaume Apollinaire and surrealist poems by Andre Breton.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Lupus Perditus - The forsaken Wolf</image:title>
            <image:caption>Responsible for his wife's death, Sven escapes into the wild in order to set an end to his life.
                Not able to pull the trigger, he feels downcast and gets stuck between two tree trunks.
                Desperate and disappointed by his weakness, he finds himself in a really life-threatening
                situation alone in the woods. That sure is not the way he had imagined his death. Getting
                worse, a rustling in the bushes nearby turns out not to be a life-saver but a wild wolf. In
                addition to these outward dangers, Sven starts hearing a cheeky voice inside his head that is
                driving him mad.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>This story follows that of an innocent sheltered youth by the name of Trey. He has a simple life and a great relationship with his mother. Yet, his entire world is rocked when he sees a video of Eric Garner getting choked to death. Shocked by this new found discovery, Trey will never be the same. This short takes a very symbolic approach to the issue of Police Brutality. Many of these symbols pay tribute to those who have wrongfully fallen before. This is not just a story of discovery, it is also a story of the aftermath of what's left behind.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>An average person spends almost a year in the metro throughout his life. We are always in a hurry to notice what is going on over there in the underground. But the life which is 60-70 meters deep requires some special watching: the watcher in the “glasses”, the people selling soft toys in the passages, the homeless, performers, the vendors of unnecessary goods in carriages- all that shapes a strange world, a ” socio-“ which exists in parallel to the down to the earth world.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>A strange debate of ideologies surfacing in the popular media sucks out reason and logicalities only to fill instead with confusion. Thus, rendering one's ideas, views and actions into a vague nothingness; so much so that the thought processes and the alternate realities, the dreams and the entire subconscious mind would delve into an augmented and of course distorted reality. The only way out of the oblivion, is by asking questions.
                One must be analytical. It's just not about the whites, the blacks or the greys anymore; everything on every plane is refracted and is further flipped and turned over into a truncated capsule of truth.
                It renders itself so intimidating that a woman wonders how to communicate when her language is so vague it is lost in misinterpretations and loss of emotions!
                The dimension of the world around her is incomprehensible, her vulnerability is ever more unsettling as she embarks on a trip to a kaleidoscopic extravaganza! What follows, is a curious story of her emancipation as she sets off:

            <image:title>Hope</image:title>
            <image:caption>The ‘Hope Trilogy’ intends to explore the fundamental emotions of hope and fear which are at the root of human existence. The first film is about a young girl lost in a rural area near a big park at dusk, as she is looking for shelter she hears a pulsating noise of a hammer on an anvil coming from a nearby hut. As she enters the hut a series of events give the viewer contrasting ideas about whether something dreadful has happened to her or is all just a synchronicity of multiple incongruous events, hence a deeply felt emotion of hope and fear. Images of arms floating on a nearby river increase the sense of mystery whether the girl is still alive or not and the pulsating emotions of hope and fear.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Kilbarrack's ode to Banksy</image:title>
            <image:caption>This video is a tribute to the renowned street artist "Banksy" and a request for his help to take down a fence that has isolated the children in Kilbarrack from using the last safe outdoor space to play in. Kilbarrack is an under privileged area of Dublin, which doesn't even have one playground. The only safe play area was in an unused car park at the back of a community center in KCCP, which has now been fenced off to keep the children away.

                This short film addresses several existential themes about the nature of exclusion, the growing trend of dividing communities, the isolation and vilification of the poor or under privileged.

                A fundamental question arises in the film and is used as a metaphor to explore why we seek to build barriers as opposed to reaching out to the less fortunate in society? Essentially, pondering what has gone wrong with our sense of community and our willingness to care for one another in society today?</image:caption>

They end up on a boat in search of an almost non-existent man as per the command of their boss over phones while their evening tea waits; Jamshed’s romance for the night waits; Hares’ urge to use a gun for the first time waits. Once or twice an impatient Hares questions the sanity of such a search to which Jamshed asks him think less and follow orders (like a puppet). Finally, Hares gets a call; his long wait to shoot comes to an end and he gets to shoot. But he is not happy; he wails tear the night apart as he was one dumb-dirty puppet.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Venus (2015)</image:title>
            <image:caption>Venus, is an adaptation of “La Maladie de la Mort” by Marguerite Duras combined with the life of the serial killer from the 70s, Charles Sobhraj whose first known female victim was in Thailand.
                Charles meets the girl, who he offered for her to come over and stay with him in a hotel room. Through the sex and sensibility of a woman, he rediscovers the pain he felt in his past. Finally, he is forced to face the truth and make a decision on whether he will conform to the emotional disease he has rediscovered, or move on from it. This short has expanded to be a feature film (in the process of writing a screenplay called “Into the Thin Air”) and will be adapted from real events with names changed from the original story for copyright purposes. The challenge of the project is that there have been many movies and TV adaptations in the past but none of them look at the killer’s deep in his soul and go through a relationship with his victims.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Get Live (Official Selection to IndieWise Virtual Festival)</image:title>
            <image:caption>“Get Live” music video is a surrealistic and ironic story, set in a dystopian world where any individuality is suppressed, and among many rules, loose hair is a taboo. An absurd dry land synchronized swimming team is being evaluated by the representatives of a totalitarian government. To their surprise, performance doesn't go as planned.
                The video is a creative collaboration between the director Adriana Roze and Latvian electronic music group “Bandmaster”, featuring Akil the MC from American hip hop group “Jurassic 5”.

                It's an Official Selection to IndieWise Virtual Festival.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Tony Windberg. A Painter in the Woods</image:title>
            <image:caption>In the midst of a vast Eucalyptus forest that lies deep in the heart of the great southern region of Western Australia, sits a cottage filled with test tubes, material samples, drafts, notes, indexed color samples and canvasses reflecting their surroundings: the trees.
                Simply calling Tony Windberg a Landscape Artist falls short of the true essence of his work. Charcoals of burnt trees, the bark and resin of various Eucalyptus trees and the soil in which they grow and die are all transformed into materials for his works of art in long, well documented procesess of experimentation.
                In addition to natural materials, Windberg utilises vinyl flooring, its varnish mimicking wood, onto which he applies a unique method of engraving complex patterns of lines to represent the impact of the timber industry on old growth forrests and the trail left behind by logging.
                Windberg‘s artwork, just as the materials that his art is made of and with, swings between untouched nature and human altered landscapes. At the center of his work is the tree, which is depicted in a way that represents the unease of the altered Australian landscape yet is delivered in a highly aesthetic manner that seduces the beholder at first glance with all of nature’s beauty.
                Windberg’s vast application of styles and multi-award winning artwork is displayed widely across numerous corporate, public and private collections within Australia. He lives and works in Northcliffe, Western Australia.

            <image:title>The 50 Yard Dash</image:title>
            <image:caption>This quirky and silly mockumentary, starring two-time Silver Fox Award winner Kaitlyn Murphy, follows a day in the lives of twenty-something undergraduates. With graduation quickly approaching, college roommates and best friends Lauren and Allie must come to terms with their post-grad lives going in opposite directions. Directed by Rachael Black and Devin Barbaro, this short film explores the pressure and emotions of four years of college coming to a close, reminding us that the most important thing we’ll take away from our higher education is the memories we've made.

            <image:title>BONGSHOJO ~ The Descendant</image:title>
            <image:caption>It is only when a man, with the sole intention of bringing joy and happiness to his family and loved ones, and retain his self esteem, overlooks his self interest and silently swallows the poison of life, that he transcends from being a mere human to that of a divine personage.
                Manab, who is under treatment and awaiting fatherhood shortly, learns that the baby growing in his wife, Neera’s womb belongs to his brother. Despite his irritation on wife’s behaviour, he keeps this secret under wrap, with a self consolation that the baby bears lineal blood though not born of his own, which would otherwise not have been possible.
                In an unguarded moment, Manab pours out the contentions of his agitated mind to a local shopkeeper. Notwithstanding the fact that he is physically incapable of being a biological father, he is aware that there are other modern techniques of enjoying paternity. Therefore he finds his wife’s abrupt action unacceptable. He holds himself equally responsible for the lack of emotional bond he shares with his wife.
                But here too, Manab selects someone to whom he confides his indictments, is dumb and deaf. Gulping the venom of resentment he prepares himself to welcome his lineal descendant.</image:caption>

The onset of claustrophobia has been attributed to many factors, including a reduction in the size of the amygdala, classical conditioning, or a genetic predisposition to fear small spaces.</image:caption>

And this library is the property of one Video Bob.
                Jim and Bill are two unassuming everyman, out for some entertainment, and when they discover the greatest film ever made lurking in their local store, they know exactly what they're after. But if they think they can pull a fat one on Video Bob, well, then shit's gonna get real ugly real fast!</image:caption>

            <image:title>Bring the cat back home!</image:title>
            <image:caption>Why cats cannot have a journey in cosmos? Dogs, monkeys, rats and even tritons - all they got their space flight. But cats did not! One day France was going to send a cat to the Earth orbit. But this unruly cat escaped before the start. So they had to send another cat instead. Ok, this second one finally got the flight, but anyway run away after her spaceship safely landed. In one word cats are rebellious creatures which prefer to escape of any strange situation.

                Also cats have troubles with zero gravity. If they get into it, they just are swirling and whirling and even twirling in the vain trying to stand on their 4 feet as they usually use to do. But this damn gravity doesn't give them a chance!

                So that's the reason why cats don't take a fly to cosmos. There is no any pleasure for them in that! :)</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Directors: Emre ÖZERDEN &amp; Emre Zengineken

                'Home' is a place of unconditional bond for each individual. Our film examines the family which is the smallest community with this idea and criticizes deterioration of society and blurring of the values. While four siblings who strap the selfish way of life meet in a funeral home and recall them to their roots, the invisible people are suddenly become visible.

                The siblings with vulnerable relationship meet at the funeral when their mother died. The neighbors clear away after they expressed their condolences and they were left alone at home alone where they grew up. Serkan opens the subject that all are curious about; he recommends a nursing home care for their father. The debate grows strongly with the rejection of Melda. Everyone blames each other. Their father was in the room when all this happens. While they are arguing, he places the favorite their mother’s record ad plays. The siblings hear the song and freeze. They all look at each other with embarrassment when Tolga says “Mum!”.g</image:caption>

            <image:caption>This amazing dance was born in the end of XIX century, when in search of happiness and a better life in Buenos Aires began to arrive immigrants from Europe , tormented by hunger and wars .
                And, as a reminder of the country, in addition to musical instruments, they carried with them the musical traditions and dances of their countries.
                Tango fully embodies all the emotional intensity , the power of people's experiences.
                However, the audience is not always visible to the emotions that rage inside performers, sometimes their emotions hide more than the human eye can see .</image:caption>

            <image:title>4242 (trailer)</image:title>
            <image:caption>Multi-award winning short film, directed by Portuguese young filmmaker Sara Eustaquio, 16. So far, '4242' got so far 24 international awards, 18 nominations and was officially selected for 67 international film festivals in 22 countries.

                Synopsis:
                Cristi has just moved to an unknown country, far away from family and friends. At first, she is happy for the challenge. But soon she begins to question her place in this new world that seems to be a lost town, made of absences, distances, silence and indifference. '4242' is the story of a young female immigrant, a story of a teenager's anguish who is trying to redefine her identity after being forced to leave home.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>ASK FOR PASSWORD -
                "In the next future, Emily, Michael and Connor are forced to flee and take refuge in a mausoleum in ruins. They are led by a soldier, Ivan. From the headland we can see the half-ruined city. The refugees are preparing to set off to find their family members. Their memories waking and sleeping show us how they had to begin to live constantly with oxygen canisters and why they had to flee. A form of pollution, still unknown to all ordinary citizens, is multiplying its effects in the soil, in the water, in the air, and it’s starting to shake the skies. The Earth's crust is suffering and reacts taking away the lifeblood: the oxygen...".

                The most important objective is to make a feature film on this theme. The far-sighted idea is to make a film for all of the elements: AIR ("Asphyxia"), SOIL, WATER, FIRE, AND THE FIFTH ELEMENT. Everything is within the theme of the impending apocalypse caused by pollution, very current and fervent theme in the world at this historical moment. The Pitch: the original idea is different and much richer. I wrote a film treatment/script (with no dialogues) for a feature film. Then I did an adaptation to shoot an independent short film. Otherwise the objective is to find the way TO MAKE THIS SHORT FILM BECOME A MARKETABLE FILM, by shooting 30 MINUTES MORE. Ask for the Pitch and more information.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>It all started when we noticed that Parisians constantly complain about their city, but they are proud of it and can't to see themselves living anywhere else. Why, then, do they stay in a polluted, noisy and expensive city? A city that does not always offer a good quality of life. Where does this contradiction come from?
                We therefore decided to make a profile of the youth of Paris (approximately age 18-35) by looking at the complex everyday relationship that young Parisians have with this metropolis.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Explain to me (the Syrian War)</image:title>
            <image:caption>Syria’s civil war is the worst humanitarian crisis of our time. Half the country’s pre-war population — more than 11 million people — have been killed or forced to flee their homes.

                Families are struggling to survive inside Syria, or make a new home in neighboring countries. Others are risking their lives on the way to Europe, hoping to find acceptance and opportunity.

                How did this crisis start?
                Anti-government demonstrations began in March of 2011, part of the Arab Spring. But the peaceful protests quickly escalated after the government's violent crackdown, and rebels began fighting back against the regime.

                By July, army defectors had loosely organized the Free Syrian Army and many civilian Syrians took up arms to join the opposition. Divisions between secular and Islamist fighters, and between ethnic groups, continue to complicate the politics of the conflict.

                Almost five years after it began, the full-blown civil war has killed over 220,000 people, half of whom are believed to be civilians. Bombings are destroying crowded cities and horrific human rights violations are widespread. Basic necessities like food and medical care are sparse.

                The future of Syria depends on its youth, but war has put their lives and dreams on hold. Once they dreamed of lives as artists, doctors and teachers. But after five years of war, Syria’s youth are a generation trapped.

                Explain to me (the Syrian War).

            <image:caption>Theeye (the fire) is an experiment.
                We all spend so much time,effort and money to groom and care our body.
                But what the whole world is forgetting is,these bodies are just walls behind which our souls play hide and seek. And we totally conceive that we are these bodies. But the reality is, we are the Souls.
                All the insecurities,frustrations,depression and fears are messages from the soul that it needs care..it needs more love and affection.
                And the cure for all the chaos happening around on this planet is, 'self realization'.
                take care of your souls.. pass on the warmth.. the fire within.. and get rid of all that pain u r suffering right now.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Asphyxia Trailer</image:title>
            <image:caption>"In the next future, Emily, Michael and Connor are forced to flee and take refuge in a mausoleum in ruins. They are led by a soldier, Ivan. From the headland we can see the half-ruined city. The refugees are preparing to set off to find their family members. Their memories waking and sleeping show us how they had to begin to live constantly with oxygen canisters and why they had to flee. A form of pollution, still unknown to all ordinary citizens, is multiplying its effects in the soil, in the water, in the air, and it’s starting to shake the skies. The Earth's crust is suffering and reacts taking away the lifeblood: the oxygen...".

                The most important objective is to make a feature film on this theme. The far-sighted idea is to make a film for all of the elements: AIR ("Asphyxia"), SOIL, WATER, FIRE, AND THE FIFTH ELEMENT. Everything is within the theme of the impending apocalypse caused by pollution, very current and fervent theme in the world at this historical moment. The Pitch: the original idea is different and much richer. I wrote a film treatment/script (with no dialogues) for a feature film. Then I did an adaptation to shoot an independent short film.
                Otherwise the objective is to find the way TO MAKE THIS SHORT FILM BECOME A MARKETABLE FILM, by shooting 30 MINUTES MORE.
                Ask for the Pitch and more information.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>In indian culture transgenders, called Hijras, belong to the so-called "third sex", neither man nor woman.
                Hijras have an ancient history dating back to the seventh century before Christ.
                As an offering to the Goddess Kali, they undergo the ritual emasculation, carried out in secret because illegal, and without anesthesia, by the Thaaiamma, a kind of sacred midwife.
                Through this surgery Hijras renounce a specific gender, as the male organ is cut off and in its place is not made no reconstruction of the female organ, as is normal in modern surgery.
                This is the reason why they are called "non-gender specific", "third sex" or "shemales".
                Traditionally considered sacred beings because daughters and priestesses of Kali Matha, Hijras live actually like outcasts, even at a lower level than the caste of Pariah, and to survive the majority of them is forced to beg and sex work.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>In Bangladesh, Accidents are frequent phenomena now-a-days,and we fall victim of it regularly. that is why even death has become natural and meagre,in one sense a weapon of convenience.
                Social values and duties have got a synonym called fairy tales.Political turmoil and bureaucracy are traumatizing public life.Our works only depict the proverb ''every man for himself"'. Society has turned into a neifelheim where gratification is dominant,ethics conceals itself in the suffocating cell of anarchic rule.
                In fact in the final conversation it is quite evident that the whole story is Yellow Journalism and a creation of the reporter.

                It is like a dead society where melodrama is presented by the dead's.</image:caption>

            <image:title>AsphyxiA- Trailer</image:title>
            <image:caption>‘’AsphyxiA’’ is a short film about suppressed memories. A man who doesn’t have the power to confront his oppressive memories and trauma; in a mysterious way, he finally gets a chance for catharsis through a painful process. Some psychoanalysts claim that trash in our dreams is a symbol of our memories. Hermes takes a refreshing bath; a bath that turns into a nightmare, when the pure clean water gets covered by rubbish, which suffocates him. A different, “empty” world unfolds for him. He trusts a mysterious woman who promises him catharsis via a peculiar way. His traumas are going to be relieved by recapturing and confronting a bunch of memories that have been suffocating him for many years. He has to get rid of this rubbish. It’s a film where the borders between space, time and reality are blurred.</image:caption>

            <image:title>TATTOO (password: 1996)</image:title>
            <image:caption>“Tattoo” is a symbolic short film, inspired by the Prometheus myth. Marina, decides to come out to her parents as a lesbian in the middle of a usual Sunday lunch. Her dad kicks her out. The question is what she is going to decide after this heartbreaking incident. “Tattoo” in the Samoan dialect means ”the correct one”.  Traumatic experiences are like tattoos. Also , like a tattoo, traumas can symbolize different things. It’s a story about human vulnerability. Also this film broaches patriarchy, homosexuality issues and tradition, family models.
                *Prometheus, in eternal punishment, is chained to a rock in the Caucasus, Kazbek Mountain or Mountain of Khvamli, where his liver is eaten daily by an eagle, only to be regenerated by night, due to his immortality. The eagle is a symbol of Zeus himself. Years later, the Greek hero Heracles (Hercules) slays the eagle and frees Prometheus from the eagle’s torment.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Mr. Cryer is a self –destructive guy who sells tears to desperate ladies. He unexpectedly meets a woman who is emotionally dead and wants to feel strong feelings . She doesn’t care if it’s pain or love but he knows that he would hate himself so badly if he could hurt a woman who doesn’t even feel pain. Is this meeting going to be “life changing”? Did they really settle their desires? Just remember that the key word is “dream”.
                It’s a surreal film noir that is setted in the boundaries of dream. The characters have no past, no explanation about their relationship etc ,such as the dreamy space that is super fluid . Everything is mirror</image:caption>

            <image:title>Point No Point</image:title>
            <image:caption>In Roman mythology a deity that protects a certain place was called the “genius loci“. Nowadays this term describes rather some kind of an atmosphere or a spirit that is inherent in a place. This spirit is created and strongly influenced by persons who live at this place. So is the spirit and atmosphere of a city mainly a product created by it’s inhabitants.

                In times of increasing internal conflicts the city has become the main venue for violent conflicts. The reasons for conflicts in urban environments are very different in this world, but they have one thing in common: people have to give up their homes, their cities.

                While in the western world the reasons are mainly gentrification and social injustice, in other parts of the world the reasons are war and expulsion.

                This film is about the „genius loci“, the spirit of the city, that is fighting together with it’s inhabitants against the city’s destruction and for keeping this home and living environment alive. The spirit and the city are strongly threatened by a dark power that is questioning the life and existence of this place, therefore the title is “Point No Point“.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Hard Rain</image:title>
            <image:caption>This Film is inspired by the song "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall" by Bob Dylan. Dylan wrote this song in the year 1962. The world was at that time highly threatened because of the Cuban Missile Crisis, therefore he wrote a song that thematized the imminent destruction of the world. Dylan said he was afraid he wouldn't have enough time alive to write songs again so he put all he could into this one.

                The imminent destruction of the world is the main topic of this film. Message and atmosphere of the song should be transferred into a film without using the song itself in it. Many of the song's motifs were concentrated in the film on one certain place: a party. This party is to be understood as an end–of–the–world–party.

                The film shows a world in which people are highly infused by data and codes. In the year 1962 the codes to launch atomic weapons would have been send on a special radio frequency. While data and codes where in the year 1962 something special, in our today's engineered world we are always surrounded by data and codes.

                This data can transport and mean anything from banal news to rocket launch codes. Therefore it fits very well that Dylan said the "Hard Rain" should not be interpreted as atomic fallout, but as the influence of media and information.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Adori Office: Two Ships (music video)</image:title>
            <image:caption>Music video for the song 'Two Ships' by electro-psych-pop duo Adori Office based in Budapest, Hungary.

                'Two Ships' follows two mysterious figures who may or may not be the members of the band. They appear here and there but don't move much at all. Soon they start bringing on images of ships and lighthouses by the means of 'reverse destruction'. Everything happens under purposely (hopefully) eerie/weird circumstances. 'Two Ships' is a love song, executed in a less than usual way.

                Shot in one day in Solymar, Hungary.
                Equipment used: Canon 650D, GoPro Hero 4 Black, iPhone 6S+, iPhone 6S.
                Drawings and masks used in this short piece were created by friends and family out of their pure enthusiasm. The film crew worked on a pro-bono basis so the total cost came to be around a mere USD 100.</image:caption>

            <image:title>This is Life</image:title>
            <image:caption>Rashid lives in a house by the sea in Bodrum. He has been spending much time on the balcony lately because he is watching the sea all the time. While he is having breakfast one day, he notices a movement in the sea. He storms out of the house and gets on his bike. He arrives at the harbor to go sailing with his close friend Captain Cavit. The reason for the movement in the sea is the Syrian refugees trying to get to a Greek island. Upon arrival at the scene, they understand that they have been late to intervene. They cannot find anyone alive on the surface of the water; refugees’ belongings are the only things floating in the sea. Ra?it is stricken by this image and unexpectedly starts to collect the clothing floating on the surface. He then goes home to hang the clothes up on the balcony to let them dry. We see him nailing pieces of wood together and digging the earth. He nails the woods together  and starts to dress them with the clothes he has collected from the sea. He takes photos and writes down the words which sink our hearts.  “This person might have been you ! Yourself !” “This person might have been your brother!” “This person might have been your mother or father!”His purpose is to attract attention to this unfortunate incident with an intense language and make people more sensitive about our refugee brothers and sisters. He does this in the most clear, striking way. He adds the photos to his Facebook account that he can barely use. He cannot believe what he sees the next morning because the photos have reached places and people Ra?it cannot think of, and brought them altogether.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Dasein Official Trailer</image:title>
            <image:caption>‘Dasein’ is a postmodern, meta-narrative avant-garde feature film. It tells the story of a young painter Aniket Chatterjee, who commits suicide by taking sleeping pills. When he slowly approaches towards death, standing at the boundary of life and death, what comes to his mind, what he realises, this film is all about that. It is a voyage from one’s consciousness to sub consciousness and at times the boundary becomes blurring.
                The film deals with issues such as person hood, mortality and the paradox of living in relationship with other humans while being ultimately alone with one self. The story revels that morality does not inherently exist, and that any established moral values are abstractly contrived. It explores the roots of eternal human desire and despair. The crisis of existence and human values in today’s material world has been portrayed in the film.
                Finally it is all about one’s search for his inner self, the absolute truth and his salvation.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Qissbah - A mythical place where people go to listen to stories and attain Moksha (Nirvana). A place from where no one has ever returned.
                Masoom Gautam Lekhi, a scriptwriter, is troubled by a dysfunctional marriage. His father had left his mother and him in search of Qissbah, never to return again.
                He wants to write a script on Qissbah and through that, find out what might have happened to his father, and if this place exists for real. This quest will take him on a journey that will lead to shattering yet enlightening ambiguities; which blur the lines between reality and fiction.
                The psyche of children from broken families, marriage, fidelity, egotism, career, Krishna, Buddha and the importance of storytelling are explored through the story of Masoom and his search for this mythical place called Qissbah.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Scenes Of Bohemian Life</image:title>
            <image:caption>Based on Henry Murger's novel "Scenes Of Bohemian Life" ("Scenes de la vie de boheme"). ) The film's plot is probably more known to the lovers of opera, rather than to the lovers of literature. Puccini's La Boheme is loosely based on the novel by Henri Murger. Konstantin Seliverstov takes action of his film from Paris of the 19th century to St. Petersburg of the 21st, while retaining the French names of the protagonists. Directed in such a way, that it emphasizes that there is Bohemian state and national borders. A bohemian life - a fun, light-hearted, romantic, sad, and sometimes, alas, is tragic. The musical accompaniment to the film matches this spectrum of moods. You'll hear great music by Rossini, Scarlatti, Mendelssohn, Straus.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>A short film about self-censorship, imposed behavioral norms, opinions and attitudes which ultimately lead to the crucifixion of one’s personality. The film begins with the retrospective memory of the earliest days of author’s childhood, and continues toward the present day, showing the process of changing and forging one’s personality. The process includes the influence of the parents and surrounding, as well as the mass-media. Through a series of short flash-backs, the author reflects upon socially-imposed restrictions and rules, she encounters in her everyday life. In the end, one question stays opened- is anyone strong enough to endure the weight of chains?</image:caption>

                Instead of arriving at the House of Echoes, known hang-out of the galaxies underworld (including his lost felon) Edward arrived at the house of Virginia Fairweather.

                Virginia is less than pleased to receive her unwelcome intruder, especially since he quite literally burst through her wall.

            <image:title>The Black Goo</image:title>
            <image:caption>Industrial Revolution made humans able to advance further into the 21st century. Technological progress came with one more effect, industrial pollution. The factories became full scale industries and manufacturing units and the issue of industrial pollution started to take on more importance. This issue is related to all of us, to the whole humanity and there is a huge need to fight against environmental degradation.
                Industrial pollution takes on many faces and it's the same for the most of the countries. It contaminates many sources of drinking water, releases unwanted toxins into the air and reduces the quality of soil all over the world.
                The Black Goo, a futuristic and apocalyptic short documentary drama reveals the issue and shows the dire consequences of unreasonable and excessive use of environmental resources. The Film was shot in the Georgian industrial town of Rustavi. To deepen the mood and heighten the impact of the film’s nearly extinctive look and to provide stronger emotional connection with the surrounding subjects, the director chose black and white colours  and dark ambient music.
                The film is experimental as the director combines and holds the roles of screenwriter, executive producer, editor and music composer.</image:caption>

            <image:title>The Trial</image:title>
            <image:caption>The protagonist, Josef K., a bank clerk, is arrested under an unjustified charge. But the arrest is symbolic - the hero is not imprisoned and is free to live his life. At first it seems that if Josef just pretends as if nothing has happened, the charge will just go away of its own accord. However, he is gradually sucked in by the trail, which becomes more and more bizarre as it progresses.
                All his attempts to break free and prove his innocence are futile, as his trail is not being conducted by any normal civil court. Josef K. is holding his own trail over himself.
                This movie is an adaptation of Franz Kafka's "The Trial".</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Would any sane person think dumpster diving would have stopped Hitler, or that composting would have ended slavery or brought about the eight-hour workday; or that chopping wood and carrying water would have gotten people out of Tsarist prisons; or that dancing around a fire would have helped put in place the Voting Rights Act of 1957 or the Civil Rights Act of 1964?

                Then why now, with all the world at stake, do so many people retreat into these entirely personal “solutions”? Why are these solutions not sufficient? But most importantly, what can be done instead to actually stop the murder of the planet?</image:caption>

            <image:title>Sunset Rock</image:title>
            <image:caption>Jasey Rae - a Midwest native and NIU Communications student with a passion for online fandom - travels to Los Angeles to research famous YouTube personality known only as Lincoln for her thesis project on social media. The relationship between fan and creator soon becomes a complicated entanglement as the pair begin developing both a new web series and a romantic bond that causes each to examine the way they project themselves online and imagine one another.

                All is not as it seems, and as the two spend more and more time together, documenting the cities famous landmarks for their YouTube channel, Jasey and Lincoln begin to unravel secrets about who the other truly is.

                Set in Los Angele’s emerging YouTube Community, Sunset Rock is a romantic coming-of-age story, dealing issues of celebrity worship, first love, and disillusionment -- reminiscent of films like Once, Frances Ha, and Like Crazy. It stars Andrew Nowak of Lincoln, Nebraska and Megan Baim of Crested Butte, Colorado, and is written/directed by Marc Wilkinson of Chicago, Illinois.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Siberia - Trailer</image:title>
            <image:caption>When Sputnik II was sent into space with a dog, named Laika on board, it was a major leap for science. Laika’s unfortunate death in space was lauded as a worthy sacrifice for the sake of the betterment of humankind’s forays into space. But that’s the human point of view. Imagine yourself as Laika – unable to understand where you’re going, what you’re doing and not even knowing if there is a way back or will you only be left circling the orbit; around the earth and the world you know but just not in it. Imagine being isolated and alone and senselessly being controlled by forces that you don’t comprehend. And even if you had the force of reason, are you ever anything more than collateral damage? Or an achievement someone can tick off his or her list? Is your only purpose to serve as an example and a sacrifice?
                The story of Siberia draws from and is dedicated to the story of Laika, sent into space in the Sputnik II. The film follows its central character, Reena, trapped a seemingly familiar scenario of a woman who believes that as she sits in her house, alone, she is accompanied by the looming presence of a large rat. This fear traps her in the confines of her own home and she goes through periods of panic, intense calm and rushes of adrenaline. But the question remains, how far has she really come and has her self-propelled exile really mattered?</image:caption>

Worried by this, the leaders decided something weird. As per them, aging single girls were forced to marry boys of their children's age. Their belief was this way daughters of their community won't go outside &amp; the boys will not be able to get girls from outside of their community, but kids like Kesar (11 Yrs) &amp; young girls like Abeera (26 Years) became victims of this malpractice. The ill effects of this tradition have been conveyed through this film "Saankal" (Shackle).</image:caption>

                ISRC: CAPZ61400001

                CARRY ON (lyrics)

                Written, composed and performed by Chad Fontaine
                Violin is played by Lisa Bates!!!

                They won't employ me,
                they would much rather destroy me,
                well, the truth is I am better on my own.
                They tell me I am deranged
                from bumming change and riding trains
                well, the truth is life is better on the road.

                Carry on, carry on,
                travel that old dusty road
                before that road is overgrown!
                Carry on, carry on,
                travel that old dusty road
                before you’re old and dead and gone!

                They say I am lazy,
                well, the truth is I am just crazy
                about catching rides for free and writing songs.
                They tell me that I am lonely,
                well, the truth is I am just horny
                so stay with me tonight and then I'm gone,

                Carry on, carry on,
                travel that old dusty road
                before that road is overgrown!
                Carry on, carry on,
                travel that old dusty road
                before you’re old and dead and gone!

                INSTRUMENTAL

                Now, I am drunk and seeing double
                and I’m looking for some trouble
                so I find the fight and stand my ground strong.
                He says he'd love to hurt me,
                but won't touch me 'cause I am dirty
                so I crack another beer and stagger home.


                Stagger home, stagger home,
                travel that old dusty road
                before you’re old and dead and gone!
                Stagger home, stagger home,
                travel that old dusty road
                before you’re old and dead and gone!

                Carry on, carry on,
                travel that old dusty road
                before that road is overgrown!
                Carry on, carry on,
                travel that old dusty road
                before you’re old and dead and gone!

            <image:title>Here Even So</image:title>
            <image:caption>A semi-biographical, experimental short film about a woman who has just recently lost the man that she loved dearly. The filmmaker, Eli Hayes, who lost his father to esophageal cancer back in 2012 dedicates this film to his mother, who knows grief all too well. Here Even So, a silent, non-narrative film, concentrates on the internal, emotional state of a widow in the aftermath of losing her husband, and the stages of grief - progressing from fear of loneliness to eventual hope. All of the artwork in this short is art that was left behind by Eli's father, as he was a professor of art history at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee prior to his passing. The film is shot in the Hayes residence, the location where the director's parents were married back in 1988 (five years before Eli's birth in 1993).</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Partners follows the lives of two, Rural North Carolina, uniformed police Officers in a small southern town; Officer John Walker and Officer Mandy Kain. Both middle aged and veterans of the department; the story, told in five separate segments, will focus more on how the two officers handle both the job and their personal lives. The story will touch on the problems police officers face in today's society; however, it will not be the typical police action drama portrayed in larger scale films or television series. The story is very character driven and deals more with the personal side of each character and the friends and co-workers which surround them.</image:caption>

            <image:title>Shadow Mountain PART ONE</image:title>
            <image:caption>Dive deep into a dark mystery that hangs like a shadow over a small town at the base of the Olympic Mountains in Washington State. Introducing Shadow Mountain -

                Logline - A teenage boy uncovers his mysterious past when he moves to a small town where his strange dreams seem to come to life and haunt him.

                Description - Cody dreams about a strange but beautiful girl, meanwhile his family moves to a small town that holds secrets about their mysterious past. His dreams have a dark side that cast a shadow that seems to be bleeding into a horrible reality that he can't escape.

                "Shadow Mountain" is the first web series from myself, indie filmmaker Ryan A. Herring. I feel I represent the new indie show runner/filmmaker that is emerging from the fringes of the industry and finding audiences online. I created the series, I wrote, shot, produced, edited, VFX, set-costume design, you name it - I did it, for this show.

                Starring real life mother and son Alison Weathers and Caleb Weathers, myself as the missing Father, and my own ten year old daughter in her first ever acting role as the little sister. Also Starring the talents of Rachelle Henry, a young actress quickly on the rise, as the mysterious girl in Cody's dreams.</image:caption>

                In a colorful world where its habitants are defined by their color, the main character, a grey creature, who suffers from seeing everyhting in black and white tries to adjust.
                He wonders "living in a colored world and having no idea what color is; what does everyone else see?".</image:caption>

                The scrolling body text is a mixture of various different sources. It's a mix of my own thoughts, a bible verse, the opening line to Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange', and lyrics to Marilyn Manson's song, 'Target Audience'.

                "And I see all the young
                believers, your
                target audience.
                Am I sorry to be
                alive, putting my
                face in the beehive?
                But I’m just a pitiful
                anonymous. Well.
                Why should I have
                to be written into
                being? What wrong?
                Thank you, it really
                does mean a lot. This
                means nothing. Get out
                of my room. The internal
                twines that are thrown to
                be. But I’m sorry
                Shakespeare was
                your scapegoat.
                My father’s prison
                beating. Get the lies
                out before they find
                your struggle to keep
                in the excuses. Even
                in the glories of
                chicanery will not
                make you happy.
                There was me, that
                is the hierarchy, and
                my three Droogs. You
                should be ashamed of
                yourself. Be sober
                minded; be watchful.
                Your adversary the
                devil prowls around
                like a roaring lion,
                seeking someone to
                devour. ‘1 Peter 5:8’

            <image:caption>Set in a present day urban environment, "Jack Boyz" is the gritty tale of an ambitious crew of stick-up men with a flawless record. Led by the wise and meticulous minded Salim, the gang follows a strict week-long regimen of cleansing and synergy before each heist. By adhering to Salim's personally crafted approach to crime, the unit develops a signature level of execution and harmony unparalleled in street crime. But when one member of the team breaks discipline and violates a key principle, he jeopardizes his team's reputation and unwittingly aids in the kidnapping of a vital lifeline; his own lover. With the Jack Boyz' integrity now in question and an innocent life in his hands, Salim must decide whether to bow out and preserve his own livelihood or prove that his exercises of discipline and harmony were not in vain.</image:caption>

            <image:title>God Among Men | 2016 Short Film</image:title>
            <image:caption>Grieving over the death of his beloved, one troubled boy faces the consequences of his actions through the malleability of his newfound life.

                ---

                Can an all-mighty, omnipotent being draw a square circle, or create a boulder so heavy that even they cannot move? If not, are they truly omnipotent? One troubled young adult, drowning in his own madness as he grieves for his departed beloved, is faced with this challenge when he wakes up as a god the morning after committing a mass murder. With his newfound life, the boy must face the consequences of his actions through the impossibility of his existence and the illusions that dwell within it. Directed, edited, produced, and written by Forrest DePoy, God Among Men serves as a proof-of-concept short film that was shot on a shoe-string budget and created over the course of half a year as part of a self-introduced challenge set by the amateur director to break into filmmaking with little to no experience.

            <image:title>SYNC - Official Trailer</image:title>
            <image:caption>SYNC tells the story of Ryan, an ex-Marine is abducted by a secret organization, but he escapes with an A.I. chip implant in his head. Ryan is trying to find out what happened to him and how to get the chip implant removed, but he is being hunted by the organization that put the implant in his head. He has to find his way home, but what he doesn’t know is that the organization that abducted him has a different plan in mind.

                SYNC was directed by Craig Thiessen as part of his high school thesis.  The film was also completed with almost no budget.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>Imagine a world where writers are original and journalists expose the real. Now imagine a world where writers are pawns, outlets for worlds that already exist. Now meet an author who thinks he is writing original content and a journalist who believes she is exposing the truth. The universe is big, where anything is possible. What if we told you every story you read, wrote, experienced, is a retelling of an event somewhere, out there in the universe.
                Meet the Ronan Chronicles, where we will show you everything is possible, because everything has already happened.</image:caption>

            <image:caption>WHAT LIES BEYOND... The Beginning
                A Film By Jarrod A Knowles
                A JAKVision Production

                IMDB:
                http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2921178/?...

                Story-line:
                While on an ecology research trip, 8 diverse college students and a witty chaperone must decide whether to fight for their lives OR fight to escape, when suddenly all hell breaks loose. Some have a hidden agenda and connections with their past, while others are bold enough to do the unthinkable. This results in a dramatic, fast-paced, extremely humorous but bloody thrill ride, which ultimately leads to the revelation of a twist(s) so sick, you shall never recover.</image:caption>
